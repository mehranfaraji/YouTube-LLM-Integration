vSSkDos2hzo,2024-09-12T14:01:11.000000,We Need to Rethink Exercise (Updated Version),"Losing weight is hard and unfortunately your 
body is sabotaging you every step of the way. Your body is a biological machine that follows 
the laws of thermodynamics and needs energy and   raw materials to stay alive, which is why you eat. 
The energy from food is measured in calories and   you need a certain amount to power your internal 
machines. Your brain thinks, your heart pumps,   your gut digests, your immune system immuns. 
And you contract your muscles to move around. The harder a movement is, the more calories you 
burn. An hour of walking burns about 260 calories,   moderate swimming 430, biking 600, running 700. If you eat more calories than you burn, your 
body stores them mostly in the form of fat.   One kilogram, or two pounds, of fat is about 
7000 calories. Seems simple. To lose weight,   you have to burn more than you eat, 
so fat is turned back into energy. There are two ways to do this: Eating less – which 
we will cover in another video – and burning more,   say by moving around aimlessly, also called 
working out. We also get told early on that   exercising is healthy somehow, so working 
out should kill two birds with one stone. Unfortunately this doesn’t exactly work out. 
It is one of these frustrating experiences   where you do what you think is right only to 
not see the results you deserve. In reality,   focusing on exercising is not 
a reliable way to lose weight. Some studies show that exercise 
can lead to some fat loss,   others that it is minimal. How 
can this be? It turns out that   until recently we fundamentally misunderstood 
what moving around a lot does to our bodies. Disclaimer: The science on fat loss 
is complicated and many studies   compare vastly different populations, different 
measurements and are complicated to understand.   And the online discussion is full of personal 
anecdotes. This video covers general principles,   based on the current state of research. 
But when you look at the individual,   there are variations – it matters if you are 
an athlete or casually try to lose weight. The Myth of the Workout A few years ago scientists began to compare 
populations in industrialized societies,   which sit a lot, to hunter-gatherer 
communities, who move around a lot.   The Hadza people in Tanzania walk an average of 
9 km a day to find wild plants and hunt animals,   dig for tubers, climb trees for honey, 
or collect water. They can move more in   a single day than an office worker in a week. 
So of course, they burn more calories, right?
  But it turns out that the Hadza burn the same 
amount of calories per day as a typical person   in an industrialized country: around 1900 for 
women and around 2600 for men – which doesn’t make   sense at all. It’s also not their genes, since 
it’s the same for other hunter gatherer tribes. So the confused scientists looked at similar 
measurements in individual countries. It got   even stranger: Active people who work out 
regularly do burn more than inactive people.   But only very little, often as low as 100 
calories, the equivalent of a single apple. For some strange reason in the long term, the 
amount of calories you burn is often relatively   unrelated to your lifestyle. Per kilo of muscle 
weight, your body has a relatively fixed calorie   budget it wants to burn per day. Sure, if 
you want to gain muscles by pumping iron,   you also need to eat more to build and sustain 
them or your new muscles wither away. But   in total, your body keeps your calorie 
budget per unit of you, pretty stable. And to make matters worse, if you want to lose 
fat your body sabotages you in small and big ways: First of all, when you begin to work out 
regularly, maybe going for a run in the morning,   your body may subconsciously make you move 
less when you don’t pay attention. Maybe you   take the elevator instead of the stairs, you 
sit more when you meet your friends or you   sleep longer – largely balancing out your burn 
again, preventing you from burning much fat. You can overcome this temporarily: If you do 
actually change your life after sitting around   for years and suddenly start working out without 
eating more, this is a shock to your system. You   actually do burn more calories and lose fat – so 
you can lose weight through exercise! But this is   often very short-lived. Your body adapts and burns 
fewer and fewer extra calories each week until it   restores its original calorie budget. After a few 
months you burn a very similar amount to what you   did when you didn’t work out. If you stay really 
consistent your burn might increase slightly and   your body composition might change, but most 
people struggle with keeping up the habit,   if they don’t love the extra movement. Which 
is why so many people hit a weight loss plateau Objection! What about muscles? Muscles burn 3 
times more calories at rest than fat. This sounds   impressive, but tissues like your brain, skin 
or intestines burn way more. In absolute terms,   a more muscular body composition makes a 
difference for how many calories your body   burns, but it’s relatively small. 
Muscles matter a lot for health,   longevity and performance, but 
not that much for weight loss. Bizarre. And now we are getting to the 
actual reason why exercise is healthy.  Why Your Body Is Sabotaging You So your body has an activity budget per 
day that it wants to stick to. This setting   evolved when humans had to move a lot. 
Not because they wanted to, but because   they had to find food for survival. But when 
food is abundant and exercise is voluntary,   what does your body do with the energy 
that you are not using to move around? We are simplifying a lot here and this is 
relatively new science, but in a nutshell:   There are many different systems in your 
body trying to do their job as well as   possible. And if there’s extra energy, they 
seem to use it. Unfortunately this is bad. When your immune cells detect injuries 
or infections, they trigger inflammation.   Fighter cells, alarm chemicals and fluids flood 
into your tissue. This is crucial but it also   causes damage, so it needs to be cleaned 
up quickly or it can become chronic. And   chronic inflammation is one of the major 
contributors to many serious diseases,   from cancer to heart failure. If your 
immune system is on a tight budget,   it has to be efficient with inflammation – with 
lots of free calories though, it over commits. Another thing is that your glands produce 
hormones you don’t need. Like cortisol,   the stress hormone, which triggers your fight 
or flight response. Crucial for survival,   but if you have too much of it you get, well, 
very stressed, all the time. Chronic stress is   a major cause for a bouquet of health issues 
including your mental state. For our ancestors   who moved a lot and had to deal with sudden 
bursts of activity, fleeing from a lion,   attacking that bison, this cortisol was crucial 
– but if you live a modern, sedentary lifestyle   your body is ready for action that doesn’t 
happen, hurting itself in the process. Your body evolved to move regularly 
and is fine tuned to a certain base   level of activity. If this activity 
is missing it still uses almost the   identical amount of energy, just on 
stupid stuff. This is why you burn  a similar amount of calories whether you 
work out or not. A lot of the energy you   spend working out is energy you don’t spend on 
other physical activities and body processes. Working out is not a magic bullet, but it seems 
to restore an internal physical balance that   seriously affects your body. And this is also 
why regular exercise is so incredibly healthy,   the evidence is incredibly clear here. It 
reduces chronic inflammation and stress,   it is good for your heart, may ease depression, 
and makes you live longer and better. Why Humans Are So Hungry When your ancestors evolved, they had to work 
hard for calories. Sometimes it would be easy   and they could afford to chill out quite 
a bit. But in hard times they had to move   quite a bit to feed themselves, walk longer 
to find prey, or dig longer to find tubers. If extra movement burned more calories this 
would lead to a spiral of starvation. The   less food you find, the more energy you need 
to find food – which doesn’t even fill you up,   because you moved more. It’s like 
taking on more debt when you are in   the red. It works for a while, but then you 
go bankrupt and die. So for your ancestors,   being able to move a lot without burning 
extra calories was a matter of life and death. Ok. But this means the obesity epidemic of the 
modern world is not primarily caused by laziness,   but by overeating. Humans evolved 
to be mad for calories. Because   of our extremely hungry brains, 
and our extremely useless kids. Kids are cute but unlike other species, 
human kids have to be fed and cared for   by adults for years before they become 
even remotely useful. Because the human   brain not only eats up about 20% of all 
our calories at rest – twice as much as   our closest ape relatives’ – it also takes 
a lot of time to develop through playing,   learning and honing social skills – 
all the things that make us human. Our species is so extremely calorie-expensive 
to maintain that we became super-efficient   calorie harvesters. 5 hours of human hunter 
gatherer foraging yields between 3,000 and   5,000 calories, while our ape relatives 
get no more than 1,500 in the same time. And we became so good at calorie harvesting 
precisely because of our big brains and years   of social skill training. In a typical 
ancestral tribe some members would spend   the day searching for plants, others hunting 
or gathering honey, others nurturing kids.   And at the end of the day, we’d share the 
calories so that no one would end up hungry. Being frenetic calorie harvesters seems to 
be deeply part of what makes us human. It's   not a bug, but a feature. But today it 
seems as if that feature has turned on   us – we can’t stop overproducing food, 
and overeating. If you want to lose fat,   reducing calories is the biggest part of the 
answer. We’ll cover diet in the next part. So to conclude: You will probably not lose 
nearly as much fat by working out as you hoped,   but you will do something more important: 
give your body balance and make you more   resilient and prevent or delay many of 
the diseases that will make your life   miserable so you can enjoy a higher 
quality of life, for much longer.  But physical fitness is only half the equation.

dBxxi5XAm3U,2024-08-27T14:00:00.000000,We Traveled Back in Time. Now Physicists Are Angry.,"You’re going forward through time one 
second every second. Congratulations,   you’re a time traveler! A bit lame, but 
let's start here to get to the fun,   real time travel to ride on 
dinosaurs and high five Einstein. Time isn’t really a thing 
that passes but a dimension,   a direction you can move in. We think our 
universe is four dimensional, with three   spatial and one time dimensions - smooshed 
together into a fancy thing we call spacetime. What you experience as time passing and your 
life happening, is actually you moving through   the time dimension. And this dimension is a 
bummer. While you can go forward-backward,   left and right, up and down in the space 
dimensions – in time you can only go:   Forward. You only get older, never 
younger, you can’t make detours. But this is an illusion. You have far more 
control over how you move through time. To   explain how this actually works without 
making a math video, we have to make a   lot of physicists grumpy, so please keep in 
mind that we are simplifying and lying a bit. Ok. So there is a very strange rule: Everything in 
our universe moves at the speed of light through   four dimensional spacetime. Your speed through 
spacetime is the sum of your separate speeds   through time and space. It's impossible for you 
to stay still. Even if you are not moving through   space dimensions, you are moving through the time 
dimension, blasting face first into the future. You can slow down in the time dimension, by moving 
faster through the space dimensions but in total,   you will always move at the speed of light 
through spacetime. If you could somehow truly   stand still in space – you'd still move through time 
at the speed of light. And the other way around. Photons, light particles, move at the speed of 
light through space. They don’t experience any   time passing because their speed in that time 
dimension is 0. In the time dimension they are   frozen in place. If you see light on earth, 
from the photon’s perspective it was just on   the surface of the sun and then suddenly crashed 
into your eye with nothing happening in between. Remember we are telling a science story here, in 
real life things are more complicated – for one,   it's impossible to truly stand still relative 
to space itself, you can only be standing still   relative to other things IN space. And you 
can’t really define a reference frame for   photons as we just did. For details check 
out our sources, but now back to our story. Ok, so everything in the universe 
moves at the same breathtaking speed,   but this speed is split between space and time.   Which leads to all sorts of wacky things 
and where we can see time travel happen. Real and Easy Time Travel When a bus drives past you it's moving a 
little bit faster through space than you   are. So it moves slower through time than you. 
Or how it is usually worded: The car is moving   slower through time relative to you. While this 
makes things feel like weird physics magic,   it's very simple. Move faster through space, 
go slower in time, move slower through space,   go faster in time. And if you add another 
person moving way faster or slower than you,   both end up traveling different 
distances in the time dimension. The story that is usually told to 
demonstrate this, is to get twins,   force one of them into a rocket against their 
will, shoot them through space super fast while   the other twin chills on Earth. And because 
one twin moves very fast through space   while the other moves slowly on Earth, they 
move at different speeds through time. When   the rocket finally gets home, they are 
no longer the same age and the younger   space twin is ready to start years of therapy 
for being abducted by theoretical physicists. This is the twin paradox and it 
makes perfect sense within the   rules of the universe. If you want to 
learn more about the paradoxes of time,   we made a video about it. But in a nutshell you 
are using time dilation, the fact that your   position in time is subjective and only true 
for yourself. With sufficiently fast rockets,   you could get as far as you want into the future. 
Technically this way you could witness the end   of the universe or look at the final thing that 
will ever happen! We also made videos about that! We should mention that there's 
another way to jump forward in time. Massive objects bend space time, causing time 
to go slower near them. On Earth the effect is   tiny - the gravity of our planet makes time 
pass 0.00000007% slower than in deep space,   far from any gravitational fields. Hardly 
useful for time travel, but it’s a start. If you move into a really strong gravitational 
field, like around a black hole, the closer   you get to the event horizon, the slower time 
passes for you. If we kidnap our twin again,   they won’t notice it at all - their watch 
ticks as fast as it always does. But from   the outside they seem to almost stand still. 
Only when the twin leaves the gravitational   field and comes back to earth do 
they realize they time traveled. Ok, so you can time travel to the future by going 
fast or near a black hole. But this is pretty   lame and has literally only downsides except 
for people who want to sort of teleport into   the future. And it makes building a gigantic 
human space empire super hard – because even   if we develop the technology to go really super 
fast between stars, going on a far away journey   will always mean leaving your home as you knew 
it forever. But now that we know all of this,   there is actually a way we could use the rules 
of our universe to travel BACKWARDS through time. The Past is a Far Away Land – Let’s go there So you always move through spacetime at 
the speed of light. If you go fast through   the space dimension, you slow down in the 
time dimension. And here we find an actual   opening for backwards time travel: The 
theory of relativity, which may be the   most solid scientific theory we know, does NOT 
forbid faster than light motion through space. IF you move through the space dimension faster 
than the speed of light – superluminal – you need   to move through the time dimension with negative 
speed. That means you go BACKWARDS through time   relative to the rest of the universe – into the 
past. Actually, scientists have been looking for   superluminal particles and given them a name: 
“tachyons”. They could exist and would have   wild properties like getting faster when they lose 
energy and of course, traveling backwards in time. Finally REAL time travel! Just like with photons, it isn't really possible 
to clearly define how time passes for tachyons   themselves – it depends on how you move through 
spacetime relative to them. But now for the first   time, some observers could actually see tachyons 
literally traveling backwards in time. Which   means they could be used to directly interact 
with the past. In theory you could use them   to send messages to your past self and change 
all sorts of things that have already happened. Maybe with some tachyon powered sci-fi future tech 
you could see a star die before it was born. Meet   your great-grandparents. Prevent your past self 
from making that one dumb mistake, win the lottery   or get eaten by dinosaurs. And create juicy time 
paradoxes that also kind of break the universe... Oh, what's that? (Short Pause) Right. Sigh... It seems there are things in our universe that 
are impossible to mix. Unfortunately the theory   of relativity, specifically forbids anything that 
starts out traveling slower than the speed of   light, to reach the speed of light. Because 
moving faster through space requires energy   and the energy required to reach the speed 
of light is literally infinite. Even if you   could gather all the energy of the universe 
you couldn’t accelerate a grain of sand to   the speed of light. You can get as close 
as you like but you can never reach it. It is possible to move at the speed of light, 
as photons do. But they ALWAYS move at the speed   of light. If you move superluminally, you will 
always move superluminally. And sadly, so far,   we don’t have the tiniest bit of evidence 
that tachyons exist. While they work on   paper, most scientists think they are not real. So for now it seems that time travel 
into the past is strictly impossible,   no matter how hard we try. The past is a faraway 
land and while we can look at it in pictures   and movies and our memories, it's locked away. 
Forever outside of our reach. While this is sad,   it leaves you with the most important time there 
is: Right now, the moment where you actually   exist – and a future that's yours to forge. 
If you want you could even time travel to it.  Luckily, shaping the future is much easier 
than trying to change the past. With the   right knowledge and problem-solving 
skills, you’ll be ready for whatever   obstacles or opportunities lie ahead. Which

cRZOUcpiOxY,2024-08-13T14:00:01.000000,"Fever Feels Horrible, but is Actually Awesome!","Fever feels bad. So we take medication 
to suppress it – but is this a good idea? It turns out fever is one of the oldest defenses 
 against disease. What exactly is it,  how does it make your immune defense stronger 
and should you take a pill to combat it? The Heat of Life On earth life is able to thrive between 
the extremes of -10°C in deep cool   pools and 120°C in thermal vents. Step outside 
this range and die. Every animal or microbe   has a temperature range that is ideal and one 
that is stressful but survivable for a while. Your ideal temperature is where your cells 
work best, where their internal machinery   is the most efficient and the animal as 
a whole the best adapted to its niche.   Humans are warm blooded animals and our bodies 
expend a lot of energy to keep us around 37°C   or 98.6 °F. Which seems wasteful, but this 
may actually be a defensive adaptation – our   temperature makes us almost entirely immune 
to one of the worst killers and parasites:   Fungi. Most colder animals and their insides 
are infected by them - but you are just too hot! Which brings us to fever. For any microbe that 
wants to infect you, your body is a world they   want to conquer. Fever is defensive climate change 
pushing an invader outside its ideal temperature   range and making the world horrible. It evolved 
at least 600 million years ago and is widespread:   most animals increase their core 
temperature when they are sick. Fish swim into warmer waters, 
lizards bathe in the sun. Bees   heat up the air inside their hive.
But you, warm blooded mammal,   you have way more drastic options. Let's
make you sick and see what happens. When Your Blood Turns Into Lava You're invaded by bacteria and viruses at 
the same time. The invasion is powerful and   you need to slow it down as fast as possible. 
Fever is part of your first line of defense,   triggered by a diverse group 
of chemicals called “pyrogens”,   “The creators of heat”. They float away from 
the battlefield and pass right into your brain,   where specialized receptors pick them up 
and crank up your internal thermostat. First you begin to shiver. Your skeletal muscles 
contract really quickly, which generates a lot of   heat in your core. At the same time usually the 
blood vessels near your surfaces contract and   prevent heat from escaping through your skin. 
Your skin cools down while your insides burn. Fever is a systemic, body wide response and 
is a serious energy investment for your body.   You burn about 10% more calories to stay 
alive for every degree centigrade your   body temperature rises. Fever is also 
a strong order to lay down and rest,   to save energy and give your 
immune system time to fight. Back to the battlefield: When the bacteria entered 
your body they tried to be stealthy. But now they   have switched into high production mode. Their 
goal is to multiply as fast as possible, which   means they need a lot of resources and are highly 
stressed. Imagine running a marathon while eating   a succulent chinese meal and giving birth. The 
last thing bacteria need right now is more stress. So your immune system tries to stress them out 
as much as possible by ordering inflammation,   which floods the battlefield with fluids,   attack proteins and soldiers. Pretty 
stressful! Fever is even more stress! For the bacteria a moment ago the 
temperature range was pleasant,   now the world burns! Heat can cause their 
organs to break and membranes to rupture,   damage their DNA and diminish protein production. 
They are seriously suffering from the heat. Why doesn't this affect your cells? It does! 
All of this is stressful for your cells too!   Virtually every system and organ of your 
body works worse during fever – except one:   Your immune system. Neutrophils are recruited 
faster, Macrophages and Dendritic Cells are   better at devouring enemies, Killer Cells 
kill better and so on. And fever animates   your immune cells to gobble up the critical 
resources your enemies need, like iron,   glucose and glutamine, turning the 
battlefield into a food desert. The viruses that infected millions of cells are   doing even worse because they are also 
very sensitive to heat. For example,   The rhinovirus that causes the common 
cold can only infect your respiratory   tract because it is significantly colder than 
the rest of your body, even without fever.  The heat is also really bad for the millions 
of cells that are infected by viruses   at this point. They are working super hard 
producing viruses, which is pretty stressful. As the heat becomes too much to bear, the 
super stressed cells panic. As their internal   machinery is breaking and failing they quickly 
produce billions of heat shock proteins,   or HSPs, that start repairs, keeping them alive. But this is a trap. Even your healthy cells produce HSPs to deal with 
the heat – but if a cell makes too many of them,   this means it is more stressed than it 
should be. And if it is too stressed,   something is wrong and it should be killed. So 
your Natural Killer Cells and Killer T Cells are   activated and attracted by HSPs and start 
killing infected cells and all the viruses   inside them. By trying to protect themselves, 
infected cells are calling out to be destroyed. But if fever is such an effective weapon,   why don’t your enemies adapt to it? How is it 
still viable, in so many different animals,   after hundreds of millions of years? A wild reason 
is that fever actually might outsmart evolution. If your enemies survive fever long 
enough, natural selection changes   them. The individuals that are better suited to 
deal with heat reproduce more. After a few days,   they have adapted. But this becomes 
a handicap – because the next step is   to infect new victims in new bodies, and 
now healthy humans are too cold for them! Not impossible to infect, just harder. And 
the heat resistant microbes now compete   with their cousins that like it colder 
and have an advantage infecting healthy   hosts. This creates an evolutionary 
dilemma without a perfect solution. To circumvent this, serious pathogens like 
measles use hit and run tactics. The measles virus   replicates ultra fast and is the most infectious 
right before your fever hits with full force.   It's brutally beaten back once your full immune 
response shows up. But by then the damage is done. Fever is an effective part of 
the puzzle of your immune system,   helping to attack and stress your 
enemies from as many angles as   possible. But if fever is so great, 
why do we stop it when we are sick? Should you Fight Fever with Medications We think it is normal to have magic 
pills, but relatively harmless,   over the counter pain medication like Aspirin or 
Ibuprofen only became cheap and widely available   in the last century or so. Going to a pharmacy to 
get something for your headache is extremely new   in human history. Pain feels bad, so we've 
gotten used to stopping it when we feel it. If you are sick, you're supposed to feel a reasonable 
amount of pain so you lie down and save energy.   This is not a bug but a feature of your immune 
system. But pain and fever are closely connected   and over the counter pain medication like 
Ibuprofen and Paracetamol also work against fever. Especially in children fever is often suppressed 
by worried parents or doctors – sometimes because   they think fever itself is the disease or they 
are worried that it can do long term harm.  In general it's fair to say that for temperatures 
below 40°C or 104 °F, fever is not dangerous   and doesn’t need to be treated.
Of course there are also patients   that should not have fever – like pregnant 
women, seniors and seriously weakened   patients. For them the extra stress may be 
dangerous. Fever over 40°C is dangerous to   anybody because it's most likely caused 
by your internal heat monitor failing. Things get more complicated
in serious disease territory. We also have evidence that for 
some diseases like influenza or chickenpox antifever drugs 
do not help you to heal faster. But we are also running 
 into ethics problems here that make clinical trials difficult. In one 
study doctors gave strong anti fever treatment to   critical care patients – but had to stop 
after mortality shot up. Overall we have   strong indications that more people may survive 
serious infectious diseases better with a fever. And there is very little clinical 
evidence that stopping fever leads to better health outcomes. But 
there are important exceptions, like neurological injuries and stroke.
We definitely need a lot more research. So should you fight fever? Well, speak to 
your doctor and don’t listen to internet   videos. But this decision is really about 
payoffs. If a fever is not dangerously   high and you can bear it, you are supporting 
your defenses and may even get healthy a bit   faster. But if you feel really bad 
and are healthy in general,  taking a pill against pain and fever 
will make you feel better quicker,   at the cost of a slightly 
less effective immune defense. However you decide, the next time 
you are burning up and feeling bad,   you can rest easy in the knowledge that your 
enemies are having a much worse time than you.  It’s thanks to doctors and researchers 
that we have these insights – we’re just   doing our part by bringing them to 
you. If you are also aiming to make   a positive difference in the 
world, where should you start? Today’s sponsor, 80,000 Hours, can help you 
with that decision. 80,000 Hours is a nonprofit   career advice organization that wants to help 
people find fulfilling careers that also do a   lot of good in the world. And their advice is 
free, without any hidden cost or fee later on. Like us, they care a lot about making sure their 
work is based on the best available evidence and   consultation with experts. So they’ve spent the 
last decade compiling and conducting research   into topics like 'how much impact can one 
person actually have' and 'what are the   best ways to make a positive difference 
on important global issues'. Turns out,   following a well-known career path isn’t your only 
option to achieve that goal. In fact, there may   be many paths that make an even bigger difference 
in the world that you may not have even heard of. The time you’ll spend on your career is 
probably your biggest opportunity to have   an impact. If you want to make the most of it,

fa8k8IQ1_X0,2024-08-06T14:00:09.000000,A.I. ‐ Humanity's Final Invention?,"humans rule Earth without competition but we're about to create something that may change that our last invention the most powerful tool weapon or maybe even entity artificial super intelligence this sounds like science fiction so let's start at the beginning intelligence is the ability to learn reason acquire Knowledge and Skills and use them to solve problems intelligence is power and we're the species that exploited it the most so much so that Humanity broke the game of Nature and took control but the journey there wasn't straightforward for most animals intelligence costs too much energy to be worth it still if we track intelligence in the tree of species over time we can see lots of diverse forms of intelligence emerge the earliest brains were in flatworms 500 million years ago just a tiny cluster of neurons to handle basic body functions it took hundreds of millions of years for species to diversify and become more complex life conquered New environments gained new senses and had to contend with Fierce competition over resources but in nature all that matters is survival and brains are expensive so for almost all animals a narrow intelligence fit for a narrow range of tasks was enough in some environments animals like birds octopuses and mammals evolved more complex neural structures for them it paid off to have more energy consuming skills like Advanced navigation and communication until 7 billion years ago the hominins emerged we don't know why but their brains grew faster than their relatives something was different about their intelligence very slowly it turned from narrow to General from a screwdriver to a multi-tool able to think about diverse Problems 2 million years ago homo erector saw the world differently from anyone before as something be understood and transformed they controlled fire invented tools and created the first culture we probably emerged from them around 250,000 years ago with an even larger and more complex brain it enabled us to work together in large groups and to communicate complex thoughts we used our intelligence to improve our lives to ask how things work and why things are the way they are with each Discovery we asked more questions and pushed forward Ward preserving what we learned outpacing what evolution could do with genes knowledge Builds on knowledge progress was slow at first and then sped up exponentially agriculture writing medicine astronomy or philosophy exploded into the world 200 years ago science took off and made us even better at learning about the world and speeding up progress 35 years ago the internet age began today we live in a world made to suit our needs created by us us for us this is incredibly new we forget how hard it was to get here how enormous the steps on the intelligence ladder were and how long it took to climb them but once we did we became the most powerful animal in the world in a heartbeat but we may be in the process of changing this we're building machines that could be better at the very thing that gave us the power to conquer the planet Humanity's final invention artificial intelligence artificial intelligence or AI is software that performs mental tasks with a computer code that uses silicon instead of neurons to solve problems in the beginning AI was very simple lines of code on paper mere proofs of concept to demonstrate how machines could perform mental tasks only in the 1960s did we start seeing the first examples of what we would recognize as AI a chatbot in 1964 approach program to sort through molecules in 1965 slow specialized systems requiring experts to use them their intelligence was extremely narrow built for a single task inside a controlled environment the equivalent of flat worms 500 million years ago doing the minimum amount of mental work progress in AI research paused several times when researchers lost hope in the technology but just like changing environments create new niches for Life the world around AI changed between 1950 and 2000 computers got a billion times faster while programming became easier and widespread in 1972 AI could navigate a room in 1989 it could read handwritten numbers but it remained a fancy tool no match for humans until in 1997 an AI shocked the World by beating the world champion in chess proving that we could build machines that could surpass us but we calmed ourselves because a chest spot is quite stupid not a flatworm but maybe a bee only able to perform a specialized narrow task but within this narrow task it's so good that no human will ever again beat AI a chess as computers continued to improve AI became a powerful tool for more and more tasks in 2004 it drove a robot on Mars in 2011 it began recommending YouTube videos to you but this was only possible because humans broke down problems into easyto digest chunks that computers could solve quickly until we taught AIS to teach themselves rise of the self-learning Machines this is not a technical video so we're massively oversimplifying here in a nutshell the sheer power of supercomputers was combined with the almost endless data collected in the information age to make a new generation of ai ai experts began drastically improving forms of AI software called neur neural networks enormously huge networks of artificial neurons that start out being bad at their tasks they then used machine learning which is an umbrella term for many different training techniques and environments that allows algorithms to write their own code and improve themselves the scary thing is that we don't exactly know how they do it and what happens inside them just that it works and that what comes out the other end is a new type of AI a capable black box of code the these new AIS could Master complex skills extremely quickly with much less human help they were still narrow intelligences but a huge step up in 2014 Facebook AI could identify faces with 97% accuracy in 2016 an AI beat the best humans in the incredibly complex game of Go in 2018 a self-learning AI learned chess in 4 hours just by playing against itself and then defeated the best specialized chess bot since then machine learning has been applied to reading image processing solving tests and much more many of these AIS are already better than humans for whatever narrow task they were trained but they still remained a simple tool AI still didn't seem that big of a deal for most people and then came the chatbot chat GPT the work that went into it is massive it trained on nearly everything written on the internet to learn how to handle language which it now does better than most people it can summarize translate and help with some math problems it's incredibly more broad than any other system just a few years ago not crushing any single Benchmark but order of them at once many large tech companies are spending billions to build powerful competitors AI is already transforming customer service banking Healthcare marketing copyrighting creative spaces and more AI generated content has already taken hold of social media YouTube and news websites elections are expected to be inundated by Propaganda and misinformation no one is sure how much good or harm can come from adopting AI everywhere change is scary there will be winners and losers one of the biggest questions governments and corporations have now is how to manage the transition to an AI boosted economy all these potential gains or risks are just the result of today's AI chat gpt's intelligence is a major step up but it remains narrow one it can write a great essay in seconds it doesn't understand what it's writing but what if the AIS stopped being narrow General AI what makes humans different from current AI is our general intelligence humans can technically absorb any piece of knowledge and start working on any problem we're great at many very different skills and tasks from playing chess to writing or solving science puzzles not equally of course some of us are experts in some fields and beginners in others but we can technically do all of them in the past AI was narrow and able to become good at one skill but was rather bad in all the others simply by building faster computers and pouring more money into AI training will get us new more powerful generations of AI but what is the next step for AI is to become a general intelligence like us an AGI if the AI improvement process continues as it has been it's not unlikely that AGI could be better in most or even all skills that humans can do we don't know how to build AGI how it will work or what it will be able to do since narrow AIS today are capable of mastering one mental task quickly HGI might be able to do the same with all mental tasks so even if it starts out stupid and HGI might be able to become as smart and capable as a human while this sounds like science sence fiction most AI researchers think this will happen sometime this Century maybe already in a few years humanity is not ready for what will happen next not socially not economically not morally earlier we defined intelligence as the ability to learn reason acquire Knowledge and Skills and use them to solve problems all things humans excel at an AGI as intelligent as even an average human would already disrupt modern civilization because they're not Bound by the same limitations as we are today's AIS like chat gbt already think and solve the tasks they were made for at least 10 times faster than even very skilled humans maybe AGI will be slower but it may also be faster maybe much faster and since HGI are software you could copy them endlessly as long as you have enough storage and run them in parallel there are 8 million scientists in the world now imagine an AI copied a million times and put to work imagine 1 million scientists working 24/7 thinking 10 times faster than humans without being distracted only focused on the task they've been given what if suddenly HGI could do all intelligence-based jobs in the world from interpreting law to coding to creating animated YouTube videos better faster and much cheaper than humans would whoever controls this AGI suddenly own the economy and thinking bigger human progress is our intelligence applied to problems so what could a million agis achieve solve fundamental questions of science like dark energy invent new technology that gives us Limitless energy fix climate change cure aging and cancer but then again sadly humans apply their intelligence not just for the benefit of all what if the agis are tasked to guide drones or pull the triggers in war or to engineer a virus that only kills people with green eyes or to create the most profitable social media so addictive that people starve in front of their screens the creation of AGI could reasonably be as big of an event as taming fire or electricity and give whoever invents it equally as much power but now let's go one step further what if the potential of AGI doesn't stop here intelligence explosion intelligence and knowledge build and accelerate each other but humans are limited by biology and evolution once we evolved the right Hardware our software outpaced evolution by orders of magnitudes and within a heartbeat we ruled this planet but our software basically hasn't changed much since then which is why we have obesity and destroy the climate for short-term gains since AGI is software on a computer once it's smart enough to do AI research the rate of AI progress should speed up a lot and that results in better AI That's better at AI research without much human involvement it may even be possible that AI could learn how to directly improve itself in which case some experts fear this feedback loop could be incredibly fast maybe just months or years after the first self-improving hii is switched on maybe it would actually take decades we simply don't know this is all speculative but such an intelligence explosion might lead to a true superintelligent entity we don't know what such a being would look like what its motives or goals would be what would go on in its inner world we could be as laughably stupid to superintelligence as squirrels are to us unable to even comprehend its way of thinking this hypothetical scenario keeps many people up at night humanity is the only example we have of an animal becoming smarter than all others and we have not been kind to what we perceive as less intelligent beings AGI might be the last invention of humanity it's possible that it could become the most intelligent and therefore most powerful being on earth a God in a box that could exercise its power to bring unimaginable wealth and happiness to humans while securing our future or it could subvert civilization and bring about our end with Humanity unable to come up with a way to stop it we'll look at some of these potential Futures in more videos but for now let's wrap up the only thing we know for sure is that today right now many of the largest and richest companies

GFLb5h2O2Ww,2024-06-25T14:00:01.000000,This Disease is Deadlier Than The Plague,"Hello, Steve here. Today I am moving over 
as the voice of kurzgesagt for something   really special. Our dearest friend John Green
would like to tell you a story that's very close to his heart. So, let's hear it
from him directly. Hey, John! Hey, Steve. Thanks so much! Lets dive right in: The white death has haunted humanity like 
no other disease following us for thousands,   maybe millions of years. It 
was there when we tamed fire,   invented culture, and ventured out of Africa 
to conquer the world. In 1815 it caused one   in four deaths in Britain. In the last 
200 years it killed a billion people,   way more than all wars and natural disasters 
combined. Even today it’s the infectious disease   with the highest kill count. But… Do you even 
know what we are talking about? We’re talking   about Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes 
tuberculosis or TB – our original arch enemy. Right now one in four humans alive are infected 
with the bacterium – you may be one of them. So   how is it possible that
we never hear about TB? Well, the White Death is the perfect human
predator: Very infectious but very quiet   most of the time, careful not to murder 
recklessly. Perfectly adapted to your immune   system and just physically incredibly hard 
to kill. What exactly makes it so powerful? The Perfect Human Predator Usually the bacterium enters your body through 
the airways and sets up home in the lungs,   a giant living cave system, defended by billions 
of macrophages, powerful guard cells that hunt   and kill intruders. The TB bug is quickly 
attacked and devoured alive. Unfortunately   this is its plan. The white death is the worst 
kind of parasite – an immune system parasite. Macrophages grab their victims, 
trap them inside a phagosome and   flood it with acid that rips them to pieces.
But TB evolved a thick, waxy coat that makes   it completely immune to those acids. Worse, 
it captures and modifies the macrophage to   be a perfect host. Like a tiny vampire, the 
parasite slowly consumes the cell. TB then   replicates extremely slowly. Other microbes that 
make you sick multiply up to 60 times faster,   exploding their numbers before the immune 
system can eradicate them. But the white death   is so well adapted to you, it has already 
won by being here. No need to rush things. When its host cell is sucked dry and dies,   the bacteria infect new macrophages. 
Although these bacteria are stealthy,   the decaying corpses they leave behind do 
activate a proper immune response – your   body knows something is up and mobilizes its 
forces. But once again, this is part of the plan. Macrophages and many other immune cells
try to kill the bacteria, but that thick   cell wall makes them a formidable fortress and 
resistant to many attacks. And it infects its   attackers in the process. So when your cells 
can’t kill them they do the next best thing:   keep the parasites from escaping. A granuloma is 
formed, a sort of white blob. In the center is a   core of infected and dead macrophages – a pleasant 
home and food for the bacterium. Other immune   cells surround this sphere of death to contain it 
– creating a safespace where TB can sit for years.   Worse, it is perfectly protected from medication 
and releases chemicals that make it hard for your   heavy immune weapons to be activated. This 
is the stalemate version of Tuberculosis.   The infection is sleeping and the bacteria is 
doing its thing. This is going on right now in   up to two billion people! But in one in ten
of them, the disease will become active. Active Tuberculosis is an emergency. But again, a 
slow one. If your immune system can’t contain the   infection anymore, granulomas burst. Suddenly 
your lungs are filled with macrophage corpses   and fresh bacteria. Your immune system panics 
and overreacts. Hordes of soldiers leave your   blood and rush to the infected areas. They 
order inflammation and fluids flood into   your lungs. But unfortunately, your lungs are 
not made to be a battlefield. In their panic,   your immune cells don’t care – they’re 
running around with flamethrowers,   trying to purge the infection 
but causing terrible damage. As fluids and dead tissue amass, it becomes 
difficult to breathe and you begin coughing hard,   sometimes even coughing up blood. And 
again this is part of the plan because   now you spread millions of bacteria 
catching rides in tiny droplets.  You burn a high fever and lose weight 
as your body is severely stressed. You   turn into a ghost version of yourself. 
Even if you are treated, this phase can   last weeks to months and is very serious. 
Insufficiently treated, TB will over months,   years, or even decades slowly overtake your body. 
Especially for children or those already weakened,   this can be too much and the disease wins the 
war. The bacterium spreads to other organs,   lung function breaks down and the patient dies. 
1.3 million people died this way in 2023 alone. The Worst Kind of Problem Tuberculosis is the worst kind of 
problem: A slow one. Instead of killing   millions quickly like Covid, scaring a 
panicked humanity into frantic action,   TB is a smoldering fire. Killing too 
slowly for our short attention span. The symptoms are often mild for many months, so 
you don’t feel in danger. Tuberculosis doesn’t   want to kill you of course, it wants to
stay alive and spread. And to do this,   it exploits human behavior: The people you are 
most likely to infect are your family and friends,   coworkers or neighbors, the people you spend a lot 
of time with. When Covid brought the world to a   halt, the average patient infected 2-3 people. An 
active TB patient infects 5 -15 people in a year. Most people catch it via breathing
in tiny droplets from a cough or   sneeze. This is especially common in crowded,   poorly ventilated housing or workplaces. 
Which is why TB exploded during the   Industrial Revolution. And indeed wherever we 
see new unplanned and overcrowded urbanization,   from Lagos to St. Petersburg, we tend to 
see a rise of the White Death alongside it. Today most cases of active Tuberculosis 
– the version that spreads the disease   further – can be cured with a four-month 
regimen of four different antibiotics. But   if that’s the case… How is this still the
deadliest infectious disease on earth? Between 1940 and 1965, humans developed several 
drugs to fight TB, finally making it curable.   It was a true achievement of human ingenuity. 
But we didn’t do a great job of distributing   the cure. While Tuberculosis is almost extinct 
in much of Europe, the US and the Middle East,   it is still a very real threat in most of the 
world. TB kills people primarily in Africa,   South America and Asia. In 2022 two thirds 
of all TB cases were in just six countries:   India, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, 
Pakistan and Nigeria. Almost half of all   Tuberculosis deaths happened in South East Asia. But as it is a slow problem like climate change, 
it was ignored instead of fought aggressively,   which enabled more and more strains of 
TB to develop antibiotic resistance.   Which is a problem because we 
kinda stopped making new drugs. In the first twentyfive years of the 
antibiotic era, we developed eight   different classes of drugs to treat TB. And 
then, in the 47 years between 1965 and 2012,   we developed none. Developing new drugs 
is extremely expensive and there was no   concentrated effort to eradicate TB, 
and there simply wasn’t enough profit   incentive. There is a vaccine, but it’s over 
100 years old and not particularly effective. But beginning in 2012, we did finally develop 
two new classes of drugs that treat TB,   and we may finally be at an inflection 
point again, as better vaccines are on the   horizon. Companies that made Covid tests
also developed a quick test for TB. So,   we now have a real opportunity to push 
this disease back until it dies forever. But only if we get enough people to know about 
TB – like you do now – and to care about it. A   century ago in the United States, there were 
almost as many hospital beds for TB patients   as for treating all other illnesses and injuries 
combined. The White Death was a leading cause of   death in the US and then one day it just 
wasn’t anymore. And we can do this again. 4,000 people died of tuberculosis yesterday, 
and we simply don’t have to accept a world   where so many of us still die of a disease 
we know how to cure. The White Death has   been with us for millions of years. It is 
time to continue our journey without it. If you want to learn more about 
tuberculosis and the folks working   to fight it through clinical trials and care
delivery and also learn how you can help,   check out the organization Partners in Health
at pih.org/programs/tuberculosis. We’ve put   a link in the description for you. Also, if 
this wasn’t enough TB for you, there’s a Crash   Course Lecture on the history and presence 
of TB. We’ll include a link to that as well. Steve, I'll see you on Fri....no! This isn't
Vlogbrothers...soon. I'll see you soon, Steve."
UebSfjmQNvs,2024-06-11T14:00:01.000000,Do You Have a Free Will?,"Are you free? Free to choose what you do 
and make decisions? Or are you an NPC,   unable to decide anything for yourself? You 
feel that you have control over your life,   or at least what you’ll have for breakfast. 
But this may be an illusion. Physics actually   may force you to go through life as 
if on rails, with no free will at all. You experience free will all the time. Like when   you decided to watch this video 
instead of doing something useful.   Free will is your ability to decide by yourself 
what you do. It means that the future is an open   arena that you can shape with your actions. It’s 
at the core of human relationships – it means   you are responsible for your actions, which 
is the basis of our moral and legal systems. There are too many dimensions for one short 
video – moral, psychological, biological,   so we’ll focus on the most essential 
part: Is free will even possible? Two main philosophical camps are fighting 
about this. No matter how we represent them,   they'll be upset about it – so we’ll use 
our own words. The first camp claims that   the very idea of free will is fundamentally 
incompatible with the laws of the universe: You Are an NPC Whatever “you” exactly are, it's 
somehow made up of your physical   brain and body. And these are made of cells,   which are made of proteins, which are made of 
atoms and particles like protons or electrons. So fundamentally, you are a specific, quite 
lovely, dynamic pattern of particles. Particles   have no will, no motivation, no freedom, 
they blindly follow the laws of physics.   And we don’t know why, but most laws 
of physics are deterministic – which   means that things happen the way they do 
because of the things that came before. If you play pool and hit a ball at a specific 
speed and angle, the laws of physics tell you   exactly how all the balls on the table will 
behave – their speeds, recoil directions,   everything. These laws completely decide the 
behavior of all balls on the table. At the   microscopic level things work very much 
like that, only without players. Actions   and reactions affect all the particles in the 
universe, creating a chain of causal effects   that extends throughout time, from the past to the 
future. Things happen, making other things happen. Now imagine that if, right after the 
Big Bang, a supersmart supercomputer   looked at every single particle in the 
universe and noted all their properties.   Just by applying the deterministic laws 
of physics, it should be able to predict   what all the particles in existence 
would be doing until the end of time. But if you are made of particles and 
it’s technically possible to calculate   what particles will do forever, then 
you never decided anything. Your past,   present and future were already 
predetermined and decided at the   Big Bang. That would mean there is a kind of 
fate and you are not free to decide anything. You may feel like you make decisions, 
but you're actually on autopilot. The   motions of the particles that make 
up your brain cells that made you   watch this video were decided 14 billion 
years ago. You are just in the room when   it happens. You're only witnessing how the 
universe inside you unfolds in real time. But this can’t be true because of quantum 
mechanics, right? Quantum processes are   intrinsically random, not deterministic, and 
can’t be predicted with total certainty. On   the quantum pool table, balls can go 
randomly left or up or banana. Their   behavior isn’t set by what came before 
but randomly decided in real time. But for the no-free-will camp, this doesn’t 
affect their argument . They think that since   quantum processes are random, they don’t allow 
you to make any decisions. Because if there is   randomness for the things that fundamentally 
make up your brain and body, these random   processes make the decisions for you. How? Say an electron can randomly go right or 
left. If it goes left, it triggers electric   currents between your neurons that create a 
neuronal process, which triggers a long chain   of actions that make you watch a youtube video. 
Or it goes right and makes you clean your room.   Just because the chain is extremely complex 
doesn’t mean you have any control over it. So maybe your fate was not decided at the Big 
Bang but it is decided at this very moment. The   important part is that it's not decided by you. 
You get no say in this, you have no free will. Wow. This is kind of a bummer because the 
argument fundamentally seems to make sense.   Except nooooooo, screams the free will side, this 
is a really bad way to think about the universe. You Are The Main Character We know that we can reduce everything that 
exists to its basic particles and the laws that   guide them. While this makes physics feel like the 
only scientific discipline that actually matters,   there is a problem: You can’t explain everything 
in our universe only in terms of particles. One key fact about reality that we can’t 
explain by looking just at electrons and   quantum stuff is emergence. Emergence is 
when many small things together create   new fundamental traits that didn’t exist before. A drop of water is just a 
sextillion H2O molecules.   If you get water on your pants, they get 
wet. But what is… wetness? H2O molecules   are not wet. But your pants are definitely 
wet now. Many small things together just   created something new that doesn't exist 
at the level of the individual molecules. Emergence occurs at all levels of reality, 
and reality seems to be organized in layers:   atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, you, 
society. Put many things in one layer together   and they’ll create the next layer up. Every 
time they do, entirely new properties emerge. One Atom can’t handle information, but many 
of them together can form a DNA molecule.   Molecules are not alive, but many of them can form 
a cell, and cells are alive. With each jump up the   complexity ladder the rules of what's possible 
change. Completely new things emerge that are much   more than the sum of their parts. And here the 
reductionist view of the universe breaks down. The layers of reality need each other to make 
sense. You can explain living things with cells,   cells with molecules and molecules 
with atoms. But because of emergence,   you can’t start with quantum particles and 
reconstruct the universe. You can’t explain   galaxies with quantum mechanics, 
or human psychology with quarks. This is not the whole story. Reality is not 
just structured in layers but for some reason   the layers are also largely independent of 
each other. Things existing within the same   layer can influence each other and maybe 
a layer up or down. But often they don’t   seem to influence things much higher up or 
down. To figure out how your organs work,   you don’t need quarks. To understand politics, 
you don’t need to know about cells! If you want   to explain things happening on one layer, you 
can only do that by staying close to that layer. “Noooooooo” screams the no-free-will camp   in frustration. “You can’t just 
use magic to explain free will!” But the emergence argument doesn’t invoke 
magic. It just says that thinking about free   will in terms of determinism and fundamental 
laws is a dead end. A kind of category error,   like trying to explain galaxies by 
looking at your digestive tract.   It is part of a reductionist school 
of thinking about the universe that   very successfully shaped science for a long 
time – but that's challenged by emergence. So maybe, trying to understand free will 
by looking at fundamental particles,   deterministic laws and quantum 
mechanics misses the point. The   question we should be asking is – which 
layer of reality is relevant to free will? Well, just like no individual molecule creates 
wetness, not a single cell in your brain wants   to watch Youtube. But one layer up, your 
brain made of 80 billion interconnected   neurons does. On this layer all the things 
relevant to you emerge: your consciousness,   character, feelings, your fears and dreams. This 
is where you emerge. We don’t know why and how,   but we know that you're here, right now. 
How all the things going on in your brain   play off each other to make you who you are 
is a whole different can of worms – but on   this layer of reality, you are part of the 
decision process. Because, at this level,   “you” are just one more physical cause of 
whatever happens in your brain. You are shaped   by your decisions and your decisions are shaped by 
you. You have a say about this layer of reality. You are not just witnessing how the 
universe inside you unfolds – you’re   actually taking part in it! And 
you are free to do so however   you see fit. At least this is how 
some on the free will side see it. Conclusion and Opinion So who is right? Is there free will? We 
don’t know. If you ask us personally,   we think the argument for free will 
is more appealing because it brings   the complexity of the universe to the table. 
Maybe existence is just the sum of its parts,   but at least for now it seems 
the universe is not that simple. But even if we don’t have free will, it’s 
not clear what that changes for practical   purposes. You and us, we humans, on a purely 
subjective basis, feel like we have free will   and that your decisions are yours to make. As 
long as we are not sure either way, and if it   feels like you are making decisions, what does 
it matter if a non-existent supercomputer could   have calculated the future at the big bang? 
Or if quantum stuff all the way down randomly   nudges your cells one way or the other. Free 
will that feels free is good enough for us. In any case, now you can decide what to do 
next. Maybe get some stuff done? Or watch   more of our videos? It’s your decision! Probably. At least you can pick which 
video to watch next -  in theory. What you have really almost no control 
over is how the state of the world is presented to   you in the news. Algorithms are constantly working 
behind the scenes to decide which information to   show you, and alarmist headlines get amplified 
over straightforward reporting. But Ground News,   the sponsor of this video, can give you 
back a feeling of independence. They gather related news articles from around the 
world in one place so you can compare coverage.   For example, last month the UK government 
passed a bill to deport asylum seekers to   Rwanda. This bill was widely covered by more 
than 150 news sources around the world. And   using the Ground News Blindspot feed you can see 
how this event is being framed by both sides of   the political spectrum - instead of one side 
that an algorithm has decided you align with.  Right leaning sources focused on the idea 
that migrants are continuing to cross the   Channel despite the bill’s attempt to act as a 
deterrent, while left-leaning sources focus on   human rights groups' opposition to the bill.
This way you can compare different viewpoints   from all over the world, see how the story 
and coverage change and be better equipped   to engage in constructive dialogue 
with those who hold different views. Go to ground dot news slash nutshell to give it a

71eUes30gwc,2024-05-21T14:00:02.000000,This Black Hole Could be Bigger Than The Universe,"We proudly present to you: The 
kurzgesagt Guide to Curiosity.   Join us on an interactive adventure across 
160 thrilling pages that will change your   perspective on the world forever.
Available now on the kurzgesagt shop. You might be inside a black hole that's 
inside a black hole that is inside a black hole.  Everything in existence could 
be black holes all the way down. It turns out black holes are much weirder than 
you think and they break the universe much more   than is usually explained, destroying time and 
space – and they may actually create infinite   universes in the process. But before we can 
get to that, let’s first build a black hole out of air. Everything can become a black hole if you 
squeeze it to a critical limit. You'd need to squeeze Earth down to the 
size of a coin for it to turn into a black hole.  The Sun needs  to be squeezed down to the 
size of a small city to become a black hole.  And if a lot of  mass is concentrated in a really 
tiny space, you get something super dense. This is usually how black holes are explained. 
Stuff becomes super dense and collapses into   a black hole. But actually you don’t 
need any ultra dense stuff to make them! We're ignoring some math here, but all 
you really need to know is one thing:   The larger black holes get, the less dense they 
are. So really large black holes are kind of thin. A sun-mass black hole is only about 6 km wide 
and has a density of about one Himalayan range   per cubic meter. The supermassive black hole 
at the center of the Milky Way has a mass of 4   million suns, a diameter of 24 million kilometers, 
and a density of 6 blue whales per cubic meter.   The ultramassive black hole IRAS 20100−4156 
has a mass of 3.8 billion suns and is as wide   as a solar system. But because it's 
so large, it is only as dense as air! This means, at least in theory, that if you take 
a gigantic balloon and fill it with undecillions   of tons of air, the moment it gets to the size 
of a solar system, an event horizon suddenly   forms and it turns into a supermassive 
black hole. Without violence or squeezing. So now let’s think big. What do we need to 
make a black hole the size of the universe? A Universe-Sized Black Hole The chunk of the universe that we can see 
from Earth is a sphere with a radius of 45   billion light-years, filled with hundreds of 
billions of galaxies, lots of gas and a bunch   of other things. If you add them up, it has the 
mass of about a million billion billion suns. Which sounds a lot – but on average, the 
universe is not very dense. If we break up all   the galaxies, stars, gas and energy, and spread 
them equally inside the volume of the universe,   we get an average density of about 5 
hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. You   can imagine this as the sort of ultra thin 
“cosmic air” that makes up the universe. What would happen if we take a balloon as big as   the observable universe and 
fill it with “cosmic air”? Well, it turns out that all the mass in the 
observable universe is more than enough to   create a black hole. Actually, it's 
enough to make a black hole 10 times   larger than the observable universe. 
But that can only mean one thing – we   should be living deep inside a truly 
gargantuan, cosmic-sized black hole! There is one catch though. We know that our 
universe is expanding – and an expanding   universe is not what you'd expect to 
see if you were inside a black hole. So   our universe can’t be a black hole – at least 
not in the naive way we’ve just described.   Except there is a wild and mind-bending 
trick the universe could play on us. To find out how, let's jump 
into a black hole and die! A Whole Universe Born Inside a Black Hole We usually imagine black holes as spheres 
with a singularity at their center,   a point where all their mass 
is concentrated so much that   our math breaks down. But this is 
a lie – they are SO much weirder. From the outside a black hole looks like 
a normal black sphere. But the inside is   where things stop making sense.  Black holes warp the universe so 
much that, at the event horizon,   space and time switch their roles. Inside a normal 
sphere, space is finite but time goes on forever.   But inside a black hole it's the other way around 
– space goes on forever but time is finite. So once inside, you see an infinite universe 
with no center. The geometry is too complicated,   so we're simplifying. But basically 
you could walk forever in one direction   or walk in another direction and 
arrive at the same place again. But not only that. Inside a black hole time 
is finite, and it's now running out. So after a while you start to notice that 
space itself is slowly changing. In one   direction space is being stretched, while in 
all other directions space is shrinking – the   whole universe is being squeezed, kind 
of turning into a collapsing spaghetti. Sooner or later, the whole black hole 
universe collapses into itself. All of space,   every single part of it, is turning into a 
singularity. So the singularity of a black   hole is not at its center or in any 
direction at all. It's in the future   of whatever falls inside. We made a whole 
video about this if you want to learn more. So the singularity is not a place where you 
can go – it's an event in time that happens.   Once it happens, you and everything else that 
fell inside the black hole will be mercilessly   crushed into an infinitely small region with 
infinite gravity and infinite energy. Time,   space, none of it matters anymore, both kind of 
stop existing in ways that we would recognize. And then? Is this the end? Well, maybe not. This collapse of the black hole universe 
into a singularity looks like one of the   scenarios for the end of our universe: The Big 
Crunch, where long after the Big Bang the whole   universe collapses into a singularity again.  But if there is a Big Crunch, 
there might be a Big Bounce – like a rubber ball that you’ve 
squeezed too much and that suddenly   rebounds, space might expand again. So a new 
universe could be born inside a black hole. The funny thing about this 
scenario is that nothing has   changed in the slightest outside the 
black hole. Watching from the outside,   it's still a black sphere of nothingness. And 
yet, on the inside a new universe has been born. So maybe our universe was born like 
this and we are all actually inside   a black hole. But if our universe can also 
create black holes, they might give birth   to new universes. Is our black hole universe 
also just part of a universe “further up”,   that's also a black hole inside another 
universe? Is there an end to it? Is there   one original universe? Is the cosmos black 
holes inside black holes inside black holes? Infinite Black Hole Universes If the universe creates black 
holes that create universes,   that then create new black holes that create 
new universes, this cosmic self-reproduction   would be subject to natural selection. 
A Big Bang is a chaotic and messy event,   so it’s possible that the new daughter universes 
would not always be fully identical to their mums.   Sometimes physics may be slightly different, 
with some fundamental values higher or lower. And so some universes might be able to create 
loads of stars, planets and black holes. Others   might not, maybe creating a uniform cosmic soup 
where no stars, planets and black holes form. But if all universes are born inside black 
holes, in the long run all universe lines   that don’t create loads of black holes 
would die out. The universes with the   conditions for loads of black holes would 
become the most common and spawn the most   daughter universes. Survival of the fittest, 
but with universes instead of organisms. Our observable universe alone has created at 
least 1017 black holes so far. So maybe our   universe has the physics and laws it has, 
because it was born after a long process   of cosmological selection that favored 
the production of tons of black holes. And that would have a lovely side effect.   If universes are optimized to create as 
many new black hole universes as possible,   they're optimized to create loads of galaxies 
and stars. And thereby also, by accident,   the conditions for life to emerge. So universes 
that are the best at creating new universes are   also the best at creating life. If this scenario 
is true, who knows how many bazillions of black   hole universes might be out there. All with stars 
and planets, potentially home to others like us. So. Is our universe like this? The 
truth is we don’t know. While these   ideas are based on real science and work on paper,   they're speculative and not testable. Also 
cyclic universes don’t actually explain why   the universe exists in the first place or why it 
is the way it is. Instead of providing answers,   these are really just new questions in disguise, 
so keep that in mind before getting too excited. But isn’t it just wonderful and 
heartwarming that we're living   in a universe where ideas as big as this 
one are even thinkable? There might be so   much life. And if new universes are created 
constantly, maybe life will go on forever.  We’ve heard rumors of a chosen one.

_rBPwu2uS-w,2024-05-07T14:00:02.000000,Smoking is Awesome,"The problem with smoking is that it's 
kind of amazing – this is an irresponsible   thing to say – but if we’re going to talk 
about it we might as well do so honestly. Smoking creates a temporary problem 
and offers an instant solution. Once   your brain is used to nicotine, 
for up to 72 hours you are itchy,   nervous and stressed – but one drag 
and instantly, you feel really good. But it's way more than just a physical addiction.   Smoking helps you focus at work and 
is an excuse to take regular breaks,   which is good for you mentally. It's a tool 
against boredom, it suppresses your appetite,   it makes bad moments feel less bad 
and good moments better. It's social,   fun together and a good way to make friends as 
smokers always group up. Your lips are one of the   most sensitive parts of your body and putting 
something between them is deeply satisfying. So now that we've given smoking an honest 
introduction, let's smoke a cigarette together   to see why it makes you feel so good and what 
exactly happens inside your body when you do it. The Best Worst Thing A cigarette is dried tobacco leaves mixed 
with chemicals that make it burn slowly,   helping you to absorb nicotine, and flavours 
that make the smoke less harsh. Let’s light it. Cigarette smoke is 95% gases like carbon dioxide 
and water vapour. The remaining 5% are particles   called tar and they contain the magic sauce: 
carbon or nitrogen compounds filled with nicotine. As you inhale, billions of particles 
interact with everything they pass through,   getting stuck on your throat, tongue and trachea. 
Your lungs are like big inflatable sponges and   have a filter and barrier; the cilia cells 
with hair-like extensions covered by a layer   of mucus. They trap dust or bacteria to be 
swept away in a sort of dance. Tar particles   land in the mucus and turn into a sticky brown 
substance that stops the dance and paralyses   the cilia – allowing them to get deeper 
into your lungs: to the alveoli. Alveoli are   little air sacs and here is where your actual 
breathing happens. They have very thin walls,   so that the oxygen can transfer to your 
blood and carbon dioxide can leave. Now the magic is released. Nicotine passes through 
the thin walls and enters your bloodstream,   reaching your brain so fast that it feels 
instant. The positive effect arrives right away. If your brain had a control board, smoking 
would be like pressing all the buttons at once,   releasing loads of transmitters and hormones 
that affect your whole body. Epinephrine and   cortisol make your heart beat faster and your 
body ready for action. Dopamine makes you feel   happy and relaxed and reduces your appetite. 
Beta-endorphins reduce pain and stress. Nicotine   excites and calmes you at the same time. You 
become more alert and able to focus. Your   nerves become more sensitive to pleasant 
sensations, then your whole body relaxes.   Together all of these effects just feel great. But your brain immediately tries to return 
to normal and pushes back against the effects   of nicotine. Which is fine as long as you have 
nicotine inside your blood. But once its effects   wear off, your body is left overcompensating, 
creating a massive imbalance within itself. The more you smoke, the harder 
your body tries to push back,   which is why nicotine is so addictive: 
You stop feeling like yourself without it. It's still great, but now you 
also need it just to feel normal. If that was all smoking did, 
well that would be kind of ok. Nicotine comes with thousands of 
different chemical buddies. Cadmium,   lead, arsenic and cyanide, hydrogen 
peroxide or nitrogen oxides cause   damage wherever they end up. Carbon monoxide 
reduces how much oxygen your blood can carry. In your lungs your cilia cells struggle. It's 
hard to push mucus clogged up with tar   and some of your cilia cells die. Your alveoli 
are super sensitive and can’t handle this sort   of stress. A few of your tiny air sacs pop like 
balloons, causing irreparable damage. Your body   needs to get rid of all of this tar immediately! 
Goblet cells pump out extra mucus to compensate,   which makes breathing harder, so you start 
coughing to get the tar and mucus out. Your immune system activates and macrophages begin 
eating up tar particles. Smokers have way more of   these clean up cells here because their lungs are 
literally full of dirt. But the nicotine makes the   macrophages sluggish and inefficient. Worse, they 
vomit chemicals that dissolve your lung tissue   and cause tiny wounds that turn into scar tissue. 
Scars in your lungs are bad if you like breathing. Nicotine raises your heart rate while ordering 
blood vessels all over your body to constrict.   Meanwhile toxic chemicals get stuck, causing 
countless tiny wounds all over your body   that will turn into scars. Those scars 
leak proteins that create random blood   clots making your blood vessels even narrower. 
Constricted and narrow vessels put a lot of   stress on your heart muscle that has to 
work much harder to keep blood flowing. Inside your skin, the chemicals trigger 
enzymes that break down collagen,   the protein that makes your skin 
elastic and smooth. This creates   folds and wrinkles. Your skin ages 
much quicker and you look older sooner. But maybe the worst thing is what happens to your 
immune system: All over your body it reacts to   tiny wounds and activates, fighting an invisible 
enemy, damaging healthy cells in the process.   While at the same time the nicotine makes it slow 
and sluggish. Worse at fighting actual diseases. We could go on like this, 
but this is getting old. In a nutshell every single one of 
your organs is highly stressed  and suffers some kind 
of permanent damage. Over time fats get stuck in the scars inside 
blood vessels, which get narrower and narrower,   until they start to suffocate your organs. 
Your overworked heart beats even harder to   push blood through the extra resistance and your 
blood pressure rises. So hard that fluids seep   out of blood vessels into your lungs, which 
makes breathing even harder. The likelihood   of a blood clot blocking a critical 
passage in the body rises enormously,   which can eventually cause 
a heart attack or a stroke. Almost all smokers eventually get Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease – so many of   your alveoli are irreversibly destroyed 
that you are always short of breath,   never able to breathe freely. Once you have 
it, it can only get worse, never better again. Finally there is cancer. You get a sort 
of double whammy. On the one hand you   flood your whole system and especially your 
lungs with at least 70 highly cancer-causing   chemicals. And on the other hand you 
paralyse the part of your immune system   that kills and prevents cancer. This 
is why cancer is so likely in smokers. Ultimately, smoking is uniquely dangerous 
among the things you are legally allowed to do. The average smoker loses 10 years of life. Which 
means that some lose like 5 years and others more   like 25. You don’t know which one will 
be you. But it cuts into your health   span even more – making a much larger part 
of your life spent being chronically sick. Ooooof So why don’t smokers not just like, stop doing it?   Smokers are often seen as unhinged or 
without discipline which is unfair. Nicotine is one of the most physically and 
psychologically addictive substances known   to humanity. If you ever start using it, 
you'll likely struggle with it for the   rest of your life. The physical addiction 
lasts around 3 days – but the psychological   addiction is much harder to overcome, 
because you form strong habits and it's   connected to many social cues, like hanging 
out with friends or winding down from work. The perverse thing is that almost everybody who 
starts smoking starts smoking as a teenager.   The tobacco industry has to target vulnerable 
brains and get them hooked on the pleasurable   effects of nicotine or it would go away. Today 
about a billion people will light a cigarette,   which is a lot but at least the trends are 
looking good. In 2000 34% of adults were smoking,   in 2020 it was only 23%. Still, in 2023 
about 8 million people died from it. But it’s not all doom and gloom. There are many 
successful strategies for quitting, we’ve put   links to some in the video description. People 
who stop smoking by the age of 35 on average don’t   die earlier than non-smokers. If you are older 
than that, even quitting late can add years to   your life! It's a bit like with climate change – every
bit counts even if damage has already been done. We're not the morality or health police. 
You do you – but at least be aware what   exactly you are doing and why you are doing 
it – most of you watching this don’t smoke,   so, well, just maybe never try it. Smoking 
only really solves a temporary problem – but   it creates loads of permanent ones. Good thing I never started – but it’s   not like I never do things I know 
I shouldn’t. Like using sketchy   free WiFis or downloading files without

OvKr6loCciE,2024-04-30T14:00:02.000000,What Makes Kurzgesagt So Special?,"We’d like to tell you a story about a kurzgesagt 
video that took us over 1000 hours to create. It all started with a simple idea. We stumbled 
upon something truly awe-inspiring. A piece   of knowledge so important, we wanted to 
share it with as many people as possible.  So we got to work. It took many days and nights, 
but finally, we managed to craft a perfect script. Then the illustration and animation 
birbs took over and the visual magic   began. With lots of love and 
care, they brought the script   to life – image by image – scene 
by scene – character by character.  Finally, a soundtrack was composed 
and the narration was recorded. And at last, after over 1000 hours of 
hard work, this video was ready to be   released to the world, bringing joy 
and inspiration to so many people. So what was this very special 
video that took so much time,   so much love, and so much effort to create? In reality, every single video we create takes 
this much effort. It might seem excessive for   a YouTube video, but for us it's the only 
way. Making each video to the best of our   abilities. Be it in research, writing, or visuals. 
Always challenging ourselves. No compromises. But there is one special group of people 
that make this exciting endeavor possible:  Our Patrons. They are by our side during every part of the 
process, lifting us up, and supporting us. Spending this much time on a single 
video is a really bad business decision.  But our Patreons make it possible. They are a vital part of the kurzgesagt team. If you would also like to be a part of our 
team and help us create inspiring stories,   support us on Patreon. This way, you’re supporting

L_JQOH1tEEA,2024-04-16T14:00:03.000000,There Are Thousands of Alien Empires in The Milky Way,"What if there are thousands of 
alien empires in the Milky Way,   each spanning a few to maybe tens 
of star systems, chatting, trading,   sometimes shooting or ignoring each other 
politely? And if so, why is nobody visiting us? While the Milky Way is ancient and gigantic, 
even travelling at 10% the speed of light,   any civilization could take over the 
whole galaxy within a million years.   But we haven’t seen anybody yet. So it 
seems we are alone in the Milky Way. But this idea is built on a lot of 
assumptions. Usually when scientists   speculate where all the alien civilizations 
are, they assume technology will progress   to a point where colonising all 
of space becomes kind of easy. But what if we are thinking about 
this the wrong way? What if the   universe is full of life, but no matter 
how technologically advanced you are,   space is never easy? What if 
aliens slowly crawl through space,   expanding like humans did over the ocean? Let's 
look at the only data point we have: ourselves. The Available Real Estate in the Galaxy Oceania is a region with tens of thousands of 
islands scattered across millions of square   kilometers, separated by an unforgiving, 
deadly sea. Kind of like a galaxy. Some 5000 years ago the first people set 
out to colonise Oceania. Especially the   Polynesians achieved mind blowing feats. 
Without any modern technology they set   out into the vast nothingness hoping to find a 
new island to claim or like die far from home. But most of the pacific islands are merely a 
few wet rocks or corrals, maybe some palm trees   and if you are lucky, birds making a pit stop. 
Others with more vegetation are often hostile,   lacking the resources to really sustain a lot 
of people and remain uninhabited even today. And then there are the good islands. The Polyneisians colonised them, spreading 
their culture and society to dozens of remote   islands of all sizes. Some united in kingdoms 
spanning many islands, others were independent,   many home to competing and belligerent tribes. And 
although thousands of kilometers apart, even the   most remote islands were connected with at least 
some trade and exchange. A microcosm of humanity. But it didn’t always work out. The 
extremely isolated Pitcairn islands   were settled for hundreds of years and relied 
on trade with each other and bigger islands   hundreds of kilometers away. And then 
the local population vanished. We don’t   know why – maybe because the islanders did the 
human thing and ravaged the natural resources   until they became unsustainable. Maybe the 
decline on distant bigger islands severed   important connections. We only know their 
culture declined and they left or died out. What if space is an ocean to us? A 
hostile place that’s hard to conquer?   Would alien civilizations 
spread like the Polynesians? The Universe is kind of a horrible place The Milky Way has around 200 billion star systems 
and it seems that almost all of them have planets.   Estimates vary, but there may be some 300 million 
to tens of billions of rocky, earth-like planets,   in the habitable zone around a star, where water 
can be liquid. Amazing! Except that most of them   are terrible. Hells of lava, dead frozen 
worlds, bare rocks sterile from radiation,   blanked by toxic atmospheres. It's easy to 
forget, but Venus and Mars are “earth-like”, too. Mars is the next human frontier and fairly 
exciting – but Mars dust is poison and deadly   radiation and low gravity will make you sick. 
Mars is the worst. Except Venus is even worse,   crushing you to death, burning 
and dissolving you in acid. If humanity was really motivated and had the 
resources and energy, both could be terraformed   within maybe a thousand years – we showed how in 
other videos. But the thing is, we already have   a planet that's pretty great, so currently 
humanity's motivation is not very strong. Now let's think about this in 
terms of galactic expansion. If the milky way is like a vast ocean full of 
islands, most are planets like Mars and Venus.,   Barren rocks or corals, where nothing 
grows and the elements kill you. Imagine boarding a generation ship to travel for 
100 years or more, only to arrive at a new star   and then you get a… Mars. Or worse, a Venus. 
What a let down. Terraforming them is such   an intense investment in terms of resources to 
make it worth spending the time to travel to the   stars for bad planets. Maybe the simple reason 
we don’t see galaxy spanning civilizations is   that the economics just don’t add up for 
almost all of the star systems out there. But wait, you might say: It's actually easy! 
A high tech race with unlimited resources   could automate this process, sending thinking 
machines that report back every few thousand   years with new planets ready for fresh settlers, 
or automated ships with embryos. But if it were   that easy someone would have done it by now. So 
either we are really alone – or it's not easy. Thinking about alien civilizations you 
need to make loads of assumptions – and   for this video we are assuming that space is hard,   even for high tech civilizations that have 
broken free from the limitations we have today. Now things are getting exciting. So what if alien civilizations actually 
ignore the bad islands and just pick   the very best? Stringing together 
island empires like the Polynesians? Thousands of Galactic Empires Every star moves in its own orbit through 
the galaxy and most stellar neighbourhoods   are only temporary. At any given time, in 
some regions there will be more good islands   than in others. While simply because of bad 
luck, other regions will be pretty isolated. Earth might currently be in one of these 
backwaters, surrounded by really bad   islands for dozens of light years in all 
directions. We may be Pitcairn island,   so isolated that nobody knows we are here, 
or cares to establish a colony so remote. But elsewhere in the Milky Way good islands may 
be more common! There it would be relatively   easy for a high tech civilization to jump from one 
good star system to the next, creating connected   empires. Strings of worlds, with all the adventure 
and challenges of expansion even to really good   planets. Do they need to animate dead worlds with 
oceans? How do they cope with alien microorganisms   or strange ecosystems? Do they need to burn it 
all down and create a mirror of their home world,   or do they adapt? How many centuries do 
they need to make a planet truly their home? Empires expanding in regions full of good islands 
would probably meet each other. Maybe they trade,   maybe they fight. Maybe they have coffee 
and chat about the meaning of it all. And just like some of the Polynesian islands, 
it is likely that many of these planets would   be abandoned or for the empires to 
break apart for a number of reasons: First of all, most great neighbourhoods 
would dissolve over time and connected   islands would become remote. Then it just 
may be the nature of civilization to become   unsustainable or self destructive – humanity 
is extremely young and we’ve already flirted   with extinction. There are numerous existential 
risks, cultural, technological and environmental   that any civilization has to deal with. And 
smaller colonies on new planets would likely   be less resilient than their homeworlds and 
in bigger danger of dying out. Whenever this   happens this would leave a good island free 
again for others to rediscover and colonise. Also space is just a different ballpark. 
The enormous distances between stars make   it hard to maintain a consistent civilization 
– just think about how many cultures we have   on Earth alone. Imagine if sending a message 
between continents took decades to arrive.   Would colonies care what the home world wants 
from them, if it can neither help nor really   enforce its will on them? This also would make 
interstellar war, except the genocidal kind,   completely uneconomic. Would you go to war with 
someone because their great grandfather killed   yours? At these distances, it's not like anyone 
could easily sneak up on each other anyway. And on a much more fundamental level, if 
island empires don’t exchange relevant   amounts of genetic information – if there 
are no hook ups between worlds –, sooner   or later these populations will develop in 
different directions and eventually become   different species. Making it less likely 
that they’ll want to be under common rule. So the idea of enormously big, connected 
empires may just not be feasible if the   galaxy is an ocean where good islands are few 
and far between. But this also means that new   civilizations may pop up constantly, spread and 
partially or completely die out, even if just   by splitting into different factions. Islands 
may be recolonized and abandoned over and over. What would this mean for us? We might think we are alone only because 
we are on an isolated island right now.   But there could be thousands of worlds full of 
diverse civilizations elsewhere, that we would   eventually drift closer to - does this make 
the milky way more scary or less scary? Is it   a good thing that we'd have time to get our act 
together before we face anyone else? Or is it a   great tragedy that we might not have the chance to 
meet our neighbours beyond for a long, long time? Well we don’t know, but it is something for you to 
ponder tonight when you look up at the sky again.   Hopefully humanity is still at the beginning 
and we’re learning a tiny bit more about the   universe every day – one day, we might spot a good 
island. And if we are lucky, many more close by. One huge problem we face as a species is that we 
can’t agree on what's going on. There are loads   of news media but most of them tend to frame 
reality through their point of view. And worse   they are trying to get your attention with the 
most alarmist take, distorting reality further. Ground News, the sponsor of this video, 
helps you navigate our biased media   landscape by letting you directly compare 
different articles on the same topic,   from media with opposing viewpoints. This 
not only reveals how different sides are   framing reality for you, it also
provides you with context you would   otherwise miss. Which massively improves how 
you can access what's really going on in the   world and can help you to make up your own mind 
– similar to what we try to do with kurzgesagt. It’s like reading a meta study instead of 
one single study, giving you a much better   understanding of the world. Give it a try

kurzgesagt founder Philipp, who wrote this video,   got his information from the same news site for 
most of his life. Until during a long hospital   stay, he read all German newspapers out of 
boredom, every day – it was simply shocking   and revealing how much framing was going on, 
especially in headlines. One would be framing   an event as mildly noteworthy another as a huge 
scandal – or one side would completely ignore   events. If it seems to you that people who you 
disagree with live in a parallel world, this is   a huge reason why. But all of us really should 
have a complete picture of what's going on. And this is why Ground News is a genuine, 
personal recommendation. If you consume news,   do it with a bird's eye perspective, 
above the framing. So check them out at   ground.news/nutshell to make 
sure you’re seeing the full picture. Welcome to the kurzgesagt lab. Let’s 
conduct a few stellar experiments! We’ll first add some more mass to this protostar. 
More.. a bit more.. Wow! We’ve just created a blue   giant, a star with 10 times the mass of our sun. 
Let’s now add a couple of million years and see what   happens. A supernova! Breathtaking. And look! It 
leaves behind a black hole. Fascinating stuff. Now we record our findings. Be 
careful to preserve the sparkle! It’s now time for Duck’s final inspection.

pjoQdz0nxf4,2024-03-26T14:59:10.000000,How The Dinosaurs Actually Died,"A ruthless murder was committed! Someone killed 
the dinosaurs and we have the murderer! Witnesses   say that an Everest-sized asteroid hit 
Earth, devastated the planet and caused   a mass extinction. A simple, fascinating 
and convincing explanation. Or… is it? In the last few years, new evidence has 
reinvigorated an older theory pointing   at a second suspect. A very slow and 
liquid asteroid, 1000 times bigger,   hitting earth on the opposite side of the planet. 
Like the true crime channel we are, let's look   at the new evidence and tell a different story 
that could change everything we thought we knew… The Last Days of a Kingdom 66 million years ago, Earth was barely 
recognizable. It was the last days of the   Cretaceous, one of the hottest periods 
in Earth’s history and much more humid.   Lush jungles and woodlands covered much 
of the planet. Even the polar regions   were home to forests of prehistoric 
pines and ferns. Amazing ecosystems   that were robust enough to survive the many 
months of darkness during the polar night. Oversized animals were everywhere. 
Pterosaurs filled the skies,   marine lizards and long necked monsters up to 
15 meters swam in the oceans. And on land,   basically everything larger than one meter 
was a dinosaur – one of the most successful   animals ever to walk Earth, dominating 
the world for more than 150 million years. And then they were murdered. All 
these majestic creatures vanished   in a split-second of geological time. Why? Yes, it is true that at around that time a big 
asteroid hit Earth. But… was this actually what   killed the dinosaurs? Or did it arrive just in 
time to get all the blame? Because according to   some recent science, just before the asteroid 
struck, an ancient nightmare, older than even   the dinosaurs, decided to destroy the world. 
Let's look at how it might have done it. The Beast Slowly Awakens The ancient continents almost resembled 
the world of today but not quite. India   was still a continent-sized tropical island 
full of lush rainforests and exotic life,   on its way to smash into Asia. But this paradise 
also hosted something else. The Deccan Traps - a volcanic region a thousand kilometers wide and 
about to come to life in a dramatic fashion. The apocalypse began quietly and silently. 
About 800,000 years before the impact,   the Deccan Traps began to exhale about 
10 million tonnes of CO2 and sulfur   dioxide each year. Which in the grand 
scheme of things was not that much,   so for a long time no one noticed. The 
problem was, these emissions wouldn’t   stop. For half a million years, they started 
to dangerously pile up in the atmosphere. About 300,000 years before the asteroid, the 
Deccan Traps started to vomit lava. This was   nothing like a normal eruption – it was 
a lava flood. Imagine a landscape with   volcanos stretching beyond the horizon. They were 
constantly active, releasing a steady flow of   massive amounts of poison and lava, interrupted 
by much more violent and deadly eruptions. The lush paradise of India was the first victim 
as gigantic clouds spread toxic fumes and poisoned   the coastal regions. Clouds of ash darkened the 
sky as rivers of magma started massive wildfires,   eradicating many local ecosystems and 
paving the continent with dead dinosaurs. Still, at this point it all looked like 
a local catastrophe – one of many that   have hit our planet over its billions of 
years of history. Had it stopped here,   there might still be dinosaurs today. But 
the nightmare hadn’t even begun yet. The Beast Turns Furious The Deccan Traps would just not stop 
spewing lava. And so, after hundreds of   thousands of years of never ending volcanic 
emissions, the catastrophe became global. First the planet experienced a wave of heating,   with oceans getting at least 2ºC hotter 
in just 100,000 years. Which is bad,   but just about the timeframe that 
leaves ecosystems a chance to adapt. But then nature would pull a cruel 
prank. Some of the gasses of the Deccan   Traps heated the planet up, while others 
cooled it down. But the mix was uneven,   so after the initial warming, 
a period of cooling followed,   massively stressing the ecosystems that barely 
managed to adapt to the hotter temperatures. At the same time, the sulfur in the 
atmosphere came back down as acid rain,   while the CO2 was acidifying the oceans 
and killing the plankton – which was,   and still is today, the basis of the food web 
in the oceans. And if plankton disappears,   a massive extinction is all but guaranteed. But now the grand finale was about to 
begin. About 50,000 years before impact,   the true apocalypse came. Like a cosmic 
horror breaking out of its prison,   the Deccan Traps roared and screamed and 
began to spew out tens of trillions of   tons of magma and even more deadly gasses 
in an onslaught that lasted for several   thousand years. Rolling over ecosystems, 
devastating everything they reached. For a time as long as all of human civilization, 
this lava armageddon brought massive wildfires.   Earthquakes and tsunamis smashed and shook 
the continent. So much heat was released from   the roaring hot interior of our planet that it 
might have created hypercanes – cyclones tens   of kilometers wide, with winds reaching 
almost 1000 km/h – 3 times more than the   deadliest hurricane ever recorded by humanity. 
These storms were so massive and intense that   they could reach tens of kilometers into the 
stratosphere and rip holes into the ozone layer,   with devastating consequences for all 
life, now without protection from the sun’s   radiation. And of course, where the hyper storms 
occurred, devastation and death would follow. And if all this wasn’t enough, out of the 
guts of the earth came colossal amounts of   venom. Giant clouds loaded with mercury and 
hydrochloric acid rolled over the planet,   delivering the final blow to the remnants 
of a once magnificent and fertile world. As   food chains crumbled and the whole world 
around them collapsed, some of the last   dinosaurs to ever walk the Earth may have died 
vomiting toxic foam while being bathed in acid   rain. A cruel end for the members of a noble 
family that had ruled the world for so long. Then, it just ended. The frenetic eruptions slowed 
down and the endless natural disasters began to   fade away. But the world was changed forever. 
The monster had left unfathomable devastation   and corpses in its wake. Even the planet’s 
ecosystems far away were severely wounded. It was   the end of a whole geological era. A murder that 
started slowly and then turned loud and violent. And then it happened. Like a cosmic joke, on the other side of the 
world, a bright dot of light appeared in the sky.   And an instant later, an asteroid 10 km across 
smashed into earth with the power of 4 billion   atomic bombs. If you want to see what this was 
like, we made a whole video about it. If life on   earth was like a murder victim barely holding 
on, this was the final blow. Just too much. After the massacre, on the 
other side of the world,   the Deccan Traps went on expelling tens 
of trillions of tons of deadly gasses   for another 800,000 years, making sure the 
devastated planet stayed covered in poison. When they eventually finished 
and truly went back to sleep,   75% of all species on Earth had perished. Most 
famously almost all dinosaurs. Except – birds,   the only dinos that are still with us today. 
Their stunning beauty and diversity are a shy   reminder of how majestic and wonderful 
their larger cousins must have been. So - Who Was the Murderer? Were the dinosaurs doomed by the 
traps? Or would they have survived   without the asteroid? Was it teamwork? Well, 
we don’t know. Scientists have been fiercely   debating this question for years, but 
for now we have no definite answer. The timeline of events that we’ve shown here is 
based on some of the most recent reconstructions   of the evolution of the Deccan Traps. There are 
other ones that paint a different picture but   right now scientists are still fiercely arguing 
over this, check our sources to learn more. So like much of true crime, we can’t end this 
story with an easy and satisfying resolution. Time has the nasty habit of erasing evidence, 
so maybe we’ll never really know. But there is   something else hidden in the dust, something 
truly terrifying. As we learn more and more   about the past, we found that at least 4 of 
the 5 big mass extinctions happened at the   same time as the Earth was furiously 
spewing gargantuan amounts of magma.   The monster that might have killed the 
dinosaurs seems to be a serial killer. The worst massacre ever, the Permian 
mass extinction 250 million years ago,   was caused by the Siberian Traps – a hellish 
flood of lava that killed 95% of all the   species on earth, almost bringing life to 
its knees. Until recently, many scientists   thought that this was an outlier, but new 
evidence suggests it may have been the rule. Other big mass extinctions happened when 
the monster awoke from its sleep and the   longer and more violently it rampaged, the more 
slaughter we can see in the fossil record. So   maybe the dinosaurs were not massacred 
by a casual murderer from outer space,   but by a serial killer hiding beneath our feet. Do you need to worry about all of this? Definitely not. While the monster is real, it's 
amazingly slow and currently very sleepy.  If it were about to awake again, scientists monitoring 
the Earth’s interior would get a warning really   early – maybe even millions of years in advance. 
Time enough to prepare and move out of the way. Enough about mysteries of the past 
and onto puzzles in the present! We are testing out this project crate from our 
sponsor KiwiCo today – they offer fun crates for   kids on topics like science, mechanics, biology 
and even things like ice-cream making and yes,   dinosaurs too. Each one is like a little 
adventure in a box that lands on your   doorstep – either individually or as 
a subscription - and each box comes   with all of the supplies you need along with 
kid-friendly instructions to help guide the way. So what do we have here? A 
puzzle maybe...no, a robot crab! Well go ahead, assemble it! Good job! This is a project that 
lets you build a robot yourself   and gives you lots of background info 
on the ins and outs of how it works. We wanted to work with KiwiCo because they spend 
hundreds and hundreds of hours on finetuning and   testing their products, just like we do 
on our videos. There are more than 2000   projects available for kids of all ages –
yeah don’t worry, you count as a kid at heart. If you’re ready to explore and learn

isdLel273rQ,2024-02-27T15:00:02.000000,The Paradox of an Infinite Universe,"Is the universe infinite? Does it have an edge? 
And if so, what would you see if you went there? Today we know that the universe had a beginning 
14 billion years ago and that it's been   expanding ever since. But something that's 
expanding should also have an edge, right? Well, it sort of does. Information can’t travel faster than light. That 
means that we can only see parts of the universe   whose light has had time to reach us in the 
last 14 billion years. When we look outwards,   what we see is a sphere centered on us, the 
observable universe. But it gets a tad more   complicated – because the universe has been 
expanding, we know that the most far away   things whose light we can see are actually 
45 billion lightyears from us right now.   So the observable universe is a sphere 
with a radius of 45 billion light years.   It contains around 200 billion galaxies, 
each with hundreds of billions of stars. So for us, there is an edge: We are looking 
at the past until there is just no past left.   This edge is really more like an edge 
in time and in a sense meaningless. The real universe is for sure bigger 
than what we can see. But how much? There are two options – either the universe is 
really big but finite, or it’s truly infinite. A finite universe means that, if 
you want to fill it with ice cream,   you can do it. You need a lot of ice 
cream, but it is a finite amount. But that leads to a weird problem. Such a universe 
should have an edge, a cosmic wall where space   ends. And if there is an edge there should be 
something outside that edge. But the universe by   definition is “all there is”, so how could there 
be stuff outside all there is? Does the idea of   something outside of everything even make sense? 
Except of course there is a physics hack: You can   have a universe that has no border, but that still 
could be filled with a finite amount of ice cream. What if the universe is truly finite? Imagine an orange and a really tiny ant. 
The ant can only see a small piece of the   skin – just as you can only see a small chunk 
of the universe. But if the ant starts walking,   it will eventually walk around the 
whole orange and be back to its   starting point. So the skin of an orange is 
not infinite – but it doesn’t have a border. The universe is not like the skin of an orange, 
but it could be very similar – instead of a   sphere, it could be a hypersphere, where 3D-space 
is curled on itself. Which is impossible for your   brain to visualize unfortunately. But the 
point is: no borders, no outside of the   hyper sphere – from our human ant perspective, our 
whole 3D space is like the peel of the orange. If   you were aboard a spaceship flying in a straight 
line, you would eventually come back to Earth. How does any of this make sense? The actual 
physics is hard, so we have to simplify and   lie a bit here. But in a nutshell it all boils 
down to gravity: The way it works is that mass   creates gravity by bending spacetime. This 
bending is the strongest where the mass is,   but sort of stretches on forever, like a very 
mild tension in the fabric of spacetime itself.   This could bend the whole universe in 
a way where it bends back on itself,   which then makes the hypersphere. If you 
find this confusing, we are with you. If the universe happens to be a hypersphere, how 
could we find out how big it is? On Earth we can   see things disappear below the horizon and 
that helps us calculate how big the Earth is.   Scientists tried to find some sort of “universe 
horizon” that would reveal the scale of the   cosmic sphere – but didn’t see anything. Which 
means that if the universe is a hypersphere,   it needs to be so big that from our perspective 
it looks like we are living on a flat surface. For   this to make sense, a hyperspherical universe 
should be at least 1,000 times bigger than   our observable part. It could be a trillion times 
bigger for all we know, but not smaller than that. Some scientists thought all of this is way too 
straight forward and came up with a wilder option:   The universe could be like the frosting of 
a donut. A hyperdonut – also impossible to   visualize for your brain. This, too, means 
that if you travel in a straight line,   you'd get back to where you started.
But with fun complications. In a hyperdonut universe there is 
not the same amount of stuff in every   direction. If two spaceships 
fly in different directions,   one could get back to the start way earlier. 
This also means that light from faraway   galaxies would do fun and confusing stuff, 
in a sort of cosmic hall-of-mirrors effect. We could see far away things in two places 
– but not just that, but we would see it in   different moments in time! Because its 
light would have taken much longer to   travel in one direction than the other! 
You could see a star being born in front   of you and see that same star die 
on the opposite side of the sky. How big would such a hyper donut universe 
be? Well, because of its strange geometry,   actually this is kind of the smallest possible 
universe – potentially just a few times bigger   than the observable universe. But it could 
also be way, way bigger. We don’t know. Ok. So much for finite universes. But… What if it's truly infinite and space goes 
on forever? What would that be like? What if the universe is truly infinite? Actually, the cosmological model used by 
most scientists, describes an infinite   universe. We mostly use it to calculate 
what happens inside our observable chunk,   but if taken literally, it 
predicts an infinite universe. An infinite universe goes on, well, 
forever, with no border anywhere – also   impossible to visualize. Wherever you 
look you'll find more and more stuff   in every possible direction. This kind of 
breaks our brain a bit for a few reasons: First of all, if the universe is infinite, is 
it also eternal and has been there forever?   Was there a time where there was nothing 
everywhere and then there was something   everywhere? Well we don’t know – but we 
have a lot of evidence for the big bang,   so it really seems like the universe 
started at some point in the past. But wait – since the big bang the 
universe has been expanding. How can   an infinite thing that is everywhere 
become even bigger? Cosmic expansion   just means that the distance between 
galaxies is growing with time. Even   an infinite space can become bigger. 
Welcome to the paradoxes of infinity. Infinity gets much weirder though. As you 
travel with your spaceship in a straight line,   you find new galaxies, stars and planets, new 
wonders, new weird stuff, probably new aliens   and new lifeforms stranger than you could ever 
imagine. But after a long time, you might find the   most special thing in the universe: Yourself. An 
exact copy of you watching this video right now. How can that be? Well, everything in existence is 
made of a finite amount of different particles.   And a finite number of different particles can 
only be combined in a finite number of ways.   That number may be so large that it feels like 
infinity to our brains – but it's not really. If you have finite options to build 
things, but infinite space that is   full of things in all directions forever, 
then it makes sense that by pure chance,   there will likely be repetition. Although 
just because something is possible,   doesn't mean it will actually happen. Maybe 
the universe goes on forever but only the   boring stuff repeats itself endlessly. 
Maybe there is really only one you. But if the laws of physics are 
the same everywhere, then far,   far away gas could have given 
birth to stars and planets,   where primitive genetic information could 
emerge from chemistry. Which might have   ended up in cells and animals that evolved 
in really unlikely ways. And eventually   apes that learn how to create online videos. It 
happened at least once, so the chance is not 0. Even if the chance of there being an exact 
copy of you watching this video right now   is almost zero – almost zero is still 
a huge number in an infinite universe. Unfortunately you'll never meet. Because almost 
zero still means the chance is incredibly small.   Earth as it exists right now is so unlikely, 
you’d have to travel incredibly far to find a   second identical Earth: Some 10 to the 10 
to the 29 – a 1 followed by 100 octillion   zeros – times the size of the observable universe. 
So far that it kind of means forever far away. Still, in a truly infinite universe, every 
combination of particles could reasonably not just   (sighs) It's time to stop now. While these 
scenarios are possible on paper – we've   entered science philosophy here. Currently 
none of these ideas are testable or proveable. If the universe is infinite we will never know. The reality is, for us the universe is finite 
and has an edge. And we can see the edge,   the edge in time. Everything we can interact   with is within the observable universe and 
most likely, this will stay true forever. Even if this finite universe feels small to 
you, it's more than big enough to fulfill all   the dreams that we and our descendants can ever 
come up with. Infinitely enough for all of us. While we can’t be sure whether 
the universe is infinite,   many fascinating questions do have 
definitive answers in science, math,   and technology - and you can learn 
all about them on Brilliant.org. Brilliant will make you a better thinker and

LrIRuqr_Ozg,2024-02-20T15:00:02.000000,What Happens AFTER Nuclear War?,"Nuclear war would forever split 
human history. Into anything that   happened before and the post-war apocalypse. In the worst case, mass fires consume everything 
within tens of thousands of square kilometers,   killing hundreds of millions within 
hours. But the worst part comes   after that - nuclear war could trigger a 
nuclear winter that might kill billions,   maybe even completely collapsing our civilization. 
How does it work and what would it look like? Fire Causes Winter When a nuclear weapon is detonated, a bubble of 
gas hotter than the sun is forced into existence,   so hot that everything within kilometers 
immediately begins to burn. The terror bubble   expands rapidly, filling the sky over its target, 
creating a devastating shockwave that causes most   of the immediate destruction. Basically you 
break a lot of stuff and set it on fire – and   in the worst case this turns into a firestorm that 
consumes everything and everyone on the ground. Right after the explosion a gigantic mushroom 
cloud rises over the destruction like a demon   throning over its perverse work, but in 
the following hours a far more deadly   cloud forms. The fire burning cities, 
forests or fields, heats up so much air   that it creates its own micro climate and 
wind system. Hot air and hot smoke rise,   pulling in fresh air from the surroundings, 
and fresh oxygen stoking the flames even more.   This creates an updraft and forms 
a colossal pyrocumulonimbus cloud   that carries the soot and aerosols from 
the flames high into the stratosphere. Under normal conditions, the soot rising 
from a big fire is quickly washed out by rain.  But a pyrocumulonimbus cloud can 
reach altitudes well above the height   where rain clouds form. Once above the tropopause,   there is simply no weather to remove soot from 
the atmosphere, so it can stay aloft for years. If this happens to a single city, it’s a tragedy, 
but a fairly local one. But in a full scale   nuclear war, warring nations following the cold 
logic of mutually assured destruction, could use   hundreds or even thousands of nuclear weapons all 
at once, creating hundreds of fire storms, sending   up to 150 million tons of soot, a cube the size 
of a skyscraper, directly into the stratosphere. In the next few days and weeks the soot 
begins to blanket the earth at high altitudes,   absorbing light high above the ground 
and preventing sunlight from reaching   the surface . This is not like science fiction 
where the sky turns dark and the sun disappears.   Winter is what happens when just a little less 
sunlight hits the ground – and now suddenly a   lot less sunlight gets through. Yesterday the 
world was normal. Today nuclear winter begins. Winter Causes Hunger How bad nuclear winter would be is still an active 
area of research. It all hinges on one thing:   How much stuff will burn really hot? How many 
firestorms would be caused by the heat of the   explosions? This depends on many factors, from 
the materials a city is made of, to the time of   the year, if a forest is nearby and so on. So just 
keep in mind we are working with some assumptions. Here is the good news: Nuclear winter is 
not permanent, and definitely no new ice age.  The effects on the climate only last as 
long as the soot remains in the atmosphere,   which is at most a decade or so until it 
clears out and temperatures normalize. The bad news is that this causes almost 
immediate climate change within a few   weeks – it disrupts our climate system 
faster than any living being can adapt to. In this new climate our seasons are suddenly 
all wrong. Winters are much longer, summers   shorter and colder – or gone altogether. This 
also means less evaporation over the oceans,   which means less rain and maybe large scale 
droughts. This is bad because our food eats the sun.  Without good summers and enough rain, 
growing seasons shrink or even collapse. The majority of humanity lives in 
an area called the midlatitudes,   a strip of land that has the ideal temperature 
for our species – not just because it's not   too hot or cold, it’s also where the plants 
we eat grow best. The vast majority of the food   we eat stems from a few highly efficient 
crops, that are mostly produced in a few   very agriculturally productive regions, like 
the US Great Plains or Ukraine. From these   bread and rice baskets of the world, they 
get traded and shipped around the world. In the worst case of a full scale nuclear 
war the temperatures in the midlatitudes   will probably stay below freezing for 
several years. Nothing at all can grow   under these conditions and the world's 
breadbaskets would suddenly turn empty.  If food production crashes, the world's food 
producers would very likely ramp up prices or   even stop selling food to other countries – if 
they're still able to farm their fields at all. It's easy to calculate how many people can be 
alive on earth – you take all the calories we   can produce and divide them by what the 
average person needs to survive. If you   have more people than calories, then within a few 
weeks you don’t anymore. Humanity has only a few   weeks' supply of crops and food, not enough 
to survive this drastic drop in production. But the climate is not the only issue: modern 
industrialized agriculture is a complex affair   that relies on functioning supply chains to 
provide unthinkable amounts of industrially   produced fertilizer and chemicals to kill weeds 
and vermin. Massive numbers of specialized modern   machinery is plowing, sowing, harvesting 
and distributing. After a nuclear war,   especially if the countries that produce the 
food were part of the nuclear exchange, there   may simply be no more fuel, fertilizer or machine 
parts, because there are no more oil refineries,   ports and other essential infrastructure left, 
damaging global food production even more. Ok, so now that we set the stage, let’s look   at what science says about the 
actual wars that could happen. Actual Nuclear War Today there are two main conflicts that scientists 
think about when making calculations of nuclear   winter: a nuclear war between India and 
Pakistan and one between the US and Russia. The most likely smallish nuclear exchange would 
be fought today between India and Pakistan,   with relatively low yield weapons. Even 
in a pretty mild nuclear war like this,   the immediate explosions would 
kill around 27 million people,   which is horrible enough. In just a few 
hours, more people would die than in all   of World War 1. The ensuing fires 
would not cause a nuclear winter,  but a mild ‘nuclear autumn’. But 
even this would disrupt the climate,   and thereby global agriculture, enough to 
starve up to 250 million people worldwide. Unfortunately India and Pakistan are in an 
arms race and have been increasing the number   and power of warheads in their arsenal. The next 
stage of escalation would be war with hundreds of   nuclear weapons, the bombs and fires destroying 
many major population centers and killing over   100 million people. A war on this scale would 
cause a nuclear winter that would damage global   agriculture enough to cut the available calories 
for humanity in half. The number of people that starve to death 
would be as high as 2 billion. One in four humans alive today. The worst-case scenario is a full scale global 
war between NATO nations and Russia – or China,   which also continues to build its nuclear 
arsenal. In a war between a former,   future and current superpower, thousands 
of nuclear weapons could be detonated. In a scenario with around 4400 nuclear weapons, 
360 million people would perish right away. We   have no other event to even compare the death 
and destruction to. It's like humanity dropping   an asteroid on itself. The nuclear winter 
that follows such an apocalyptic war would   tank human calorie production by as much 
as 90%. Not only would almost all of our   agriculture take an immediate and deadly 
hit, the climate would take at least a   decade to recover. Because a war like this would 
specifically hit the world regions that produce   most of the food for humanity – recovery will 
be much, much harder than with other conflicts. Within two years the global death toll from 
starvation could rise to about 5 billion.   In mid latitude countries like Russia, China, 
Canada, the U.S. and much of Europe only a few   percent of the population might survive. 
Humanity will never be the same again. While nowhere is truly safe, some nations in 
the southern hemisphere may fare well enough   to endure, while the rest of the world collapses. 
All the nuclear weapon states are in the northern   hemisphere. So a few countries like Australia, New 
Zealand, and Argentina may be able to endure for   a bunch of different reasons. Their nuclear winter 
would be milder, they have a lot of livestock that   would not be as affected as crops. So they would 
probably stop exporting food and focus on keeping   their own people alive – assuming they aren’t 
invaded for their food by other starving nations. It's safe to say that the world would become 
extremely unpleasant for a long time and it's  impossible to know how many people will have 
died when the nuclear winter ends. In the worst   case human civilization could collapse 
and the survivors would be thrown back   thousands of years, slowly trying to recover 
a world full of scars and graves. Eventually,   when they've rebuilt civilization, would 
they ever build nuclear weapons again? We know for sure that we need to do 
anything we can to make sure nuclear   war never happens. This video was supported

wwSzpaTHyS8,2024-01-30T15:00:03.000000,Did The Future Already Happen? - The Paradox of Time,"Do your past, present and future all exist 
right now? Are you watching this video,   being born and lying on your deathbed 
at this very moment? Surprisingly,   the answer could be yes. But how can that be? 
What does that even mean? How does time work? Imagine the universe like a child painting 
pictures on paper. Each picture shows   everything that's happening in the universe 
in a single moment. With each new moment,   all kinds of things occur everywhere – people 
are born and die, galactic civilizations expand,   you miss the bus – and our universe-kid makes 
a new picture that replaces the old one. In this way you get something like a movie – 
only the moment we're in right now is real.   The past is what happened before, now 
it’s gone. The future is still to come   and hasn't been drawn yet. This is kind 
of how time feels, right? Each moment   being replaced by the next one. The past 
is far behind us, the future doesn’t exist. But what if time is something else? What if the universe-kid has already finished all 
its drawings and stacks them on top of each other?   This way we get a block – a block of time that 
contains the whole history of the universe. All   moments that have ever existed or will ever exist. 
But in this block, in this stack of moments,   the past, the present and the future are 
equally real and exist at the same time. This feels wrong – the only things 
that we perceive as real are those   things happening now. How can the past 
and future be real right now? The problem   is that according to the theory of 
relativity, they kind of have to be. Heavily simplified, relativity says 
that time and space are not separated,   but one connected spacetime. When you move 
through space, you are also moving through   the block. This means time passes differently 
for different people, depending on how they   move through space relative to each other. And 
this also means that what someone perceives as   “now” is a certain cut along the block – a cut 
that will depend on how fast they are moving. So what you think is “now” is really only your 
now – there are many different “nows” in the   universe and all of them are equally real. This 
also means there is no universal past or future. Ok. This is a lot – how does this work? Imagine three alien spaceships a million light 
years away. The first one just hovers in space,   not moving relative to you. You 
both experience the same “now”,   the same present. If you had a magical 
instantaneous internet connection,   you could do a video call right 
now and chat about alien things. The second spaceship is flying away from us at 30 
km/s, about 3 times faster than a human rocket.   It is moving differently through the block of 
time than you are, which means its “now” is   different from yours. With the magical internet, 
the aliens can talk to your ancestors in 1924,   when humanity was discovering the 
first galaxies outside the Milky Way. The third spaceship wants to visit Earth 
and is flying towards you at 30 km/s,   moving at the opposite angle of the 
second ship through the block of time.   It experiences yet another “now” – with the 
magical internet, the aliens can talk to your   descendants in the year 2124, when humanity 
has already built cities on Mars and Venus. Ok, so we have three different “nows” – so 
which one is correct? Well, that’s the problem.   Relativity is based on one powerful principle 
– cosmic democracy: the fact that the point of   view of all observers in the universe is equally 
valid. All those “nows” have to be equally real.   But if this is the case, your past, present and 
your future all have to exist at the same time,   right now! Because for the different 
aliens, they all happen in their present. This means that the distinction between 
the past, the present and the future is   an illusion. The universe is not a bunch 
of things evolving through time, like in a   movie – but a static block in which the past, the 
present and the future all coexist and are real. How can that be? Well, think about a 
galaxy outside the observable universe,   too far away to ever visit or see. But even 
if you can’t get there and don’t see it,   it is still real. The future might be the same! But if the past is not far behind us and the 
future actually exists, then… there is no   “movie”. Things don’t happen in the universe. The 
universe just “is” – like a frozen block of dead,   cosmic ice, with everything that will 
ever happen already written and decided. Is the Future Already Written? If all times coexist and are equally real, 
then the future has to be already written. But that’s not how you experience things. It 
feels like you can mold your future with your   decisions. It really feels like you're free to 
choose to stop watching YouTube to not miss the   bus. But if the future is set in stone, you 
can’t “decide” anything. So are your choices   an illusion? Well… maybe. Maybe your free 
will is a mirage. And maybe you missing the   bus was already predetermined at the Big 
Bang, so feel free to continue watching. Except...quantum stuff is 
ruining everything again. Quantum processes can’t be predicted, not even in 
principle. Not because we are silly and don’t know   how to do it – according to quantum physics, 
quantum particles are intrinsically random. For example, if you have a radioactive 
atom, it could decay at any moment,   in the next second or in the next 
million years. We can calculate the   probability that it will decay tomorrow, 
but no oracle in the universe will ever   be able to tell you with absolute 
certainty if it will do so or not. But quantum particles can change the world. Imagine a radioactive element randomly decays and 
causes a genetic mutation in a nearby mammal. And   then many generations later that mutation 
has led to a weird mix of duck and mammal   that makes no sense. Or the atom decays a day 
later and the weird creature will never exist. If quantum stuff is really uncertain, the 
future can’t be set in stone. But if the   future is an untold story, it can’t be 
real in the same way as the past is. So what happens when uncertain 
things, like the decay of our atom,   become real? Is that moment the present? Is 
this “now”? But before we saw that cosmic   democracy makes it impossible to define 
an absolute “now”. What’s going on here? It turns out that for every individual 
object – you, an alien, an atom – the past,   the present and the future are always 
well defined. Your death will always   happen after your birth – never before, and 
never at the same time. Now you are clearly   between your birth and your death. So for 
you at least, ""now"" makes perfect sense. If we don’t play tricks like going to the 
other side of the universe and using aliens   in funny ways to find out what “now” means, 
things again start to look ordered and nice,   and individual “nows” seem to exist. 
Can we do something with them? Let’s return to our block universe. Maybe the 
block does not contain the future – and maybe   we just imagined it wrong. Maybe the block is just 
the past, and a thin layer on the surface is the   present. That surface is not smooth, but bumpy 
and uneven. It’s been made by joining countless   individual “nows” – each experienced by 
someone or something in the universe,   each equally real and valid. And all observers 
do their bit, so cosmic democracy is still true. As new things happen and uncertain things 
become certain –radioactive atoms decay,   new species of mammals arise, people 
miss the bus– the border moves upward,   creating new time in the universe. 
Instead of a frozen block of time with   a future that has already been written, 
the block is growing and things happen.   You can again decide your future! Maybe 
leave earlier so you won’t miss the bus! Let’s recap. We started with time as 
a movie – one “now” after another,   where only the current “now” was real. Then 
we found out that because of relativity there   are multiple “nows”, all of them real somehow – 
which could mean that we are living in a frozen   block universe where things don’t happen and 
you don’t really have free will. And we ended   up with a kind of growing block universe, 
where time passes and the future is open. So which is correct? What is real? The present? 
The past? Are the dinosaurs as real as you are   right now? What do the aliens on the other 
corner of the universe think about all this? To be honest, no one knows. What we’ve learned 
are two possibilities to describe time, but   they're not the only ones. Some scientists think 
that the idea of “now” only makes sense near you,   but not in the universe as a whole. Others think 
that time itself doesn’t even exist – that the   whole concept is an illusion of our human 
mind. And others think that time does exist,   but that it's not a fundamental 
feature of the universe – rather,   time may be something that emerges from a deeper 
level of reality, just like heat emerges from the   motion of individual molecules or life emerges 
from the interactions of lifeless proteins. We could go on, but… aren’t 
you about to miss the bus? The concept of time is abstract and 
elusive, possibly beyond complete   human comprehension. Fortunately, there’s a 
vast world of things we do understand about   the universe that you can explore right now

Z_1Q0XB4X0Y,2023-12-17T15:00:53.000000,You Are The Center of The Universe (Literally),"A three story building is about 10 meters tall,   six times bigger than you. In the opposite 
direction, six times smaller than you,   you get things like a cute squirrel about 27 
centimetres small. So the building is just as   big relative to you as you are to a squirrel. 
You're in the middle. It's easy to understand. In fact, you are in the middle of everything 
in the Universe. Let's go on a fantastical journey together, to the small and the 
large and see if it's really true! An A320 is 37 meters long. The Rufous 
hummingbird is around 7 centimetres. Both of these fliers are 23 times 
bigger or smaller than you,   and both fly intercontinental distances - the 
tiny bird migrates between Alaska and Mexico!   If the hummingbird were the same size as the jet, 
it would circle the Earth 85 times every year! Dinoponera, the largest ant in the world, 
is about 55 times smaller than you.  Their small colonies  have around 100 individuals but no queens – instead they ruthlessly compete for status   within the nest, which can reach 1.2 meters deep. 
If humans lived like Dinoponera, we’d be building   towers of over 25 stories filled with offices 
and ruthlessly competing for status and...wait… The deadliest and most annoying insect in the 
world is the mosquito, 235 times smaller than you,   while on the other end the Empire state building 
is about that much larger than you. Kind of   unimaginable how something this small creates 
so much devastation for something that big. We are getting to the borders 
of human perception now. Like coarse grains of sand about 3 
millimeters, 550 times smaller than you.   You can feel their shape and roughness 
between your fingers and if you focus,   see them individually. We mix them into concrete 
that can hold up the tallest towers ever built,   like the 828 meter tall Burj Khalifa that is 500 
times larger than you. If you were that tall,   people would be as small to you as grains 
of sand in your hand. Hey! Be gentle. Anything smaller or bigger 
and it becomes hard to grasp. A medium sized city like Lisbon 
is about 6000 times larger than   yourself and permeated by a network 
of highways, roads and alleys. On the other end, about 6000 times smaller 
than you, are your small arteries permeating   your whole body. Actually you are in the middle 
between your network of blood vessels and the   network of a city like Lisbon. If you think of 
a city as a living being, you find more and more   parallels. A small alley is as small to the city 
as an arteriole 0.1 millimeters wide is to you.   Your tiniest capillaries are to you, what the 
pipes bringing water to homes are to Lisbon. Going further, 100,000 times smaller than 
you, we reach a typical skin cell about 30   micrometers in diameter, a Neutrophil is half as 
big and one of your red blood cells is merely 7   micrometers. They are as small to you, as you 
are to the entire Tokyo Metropolitan Area,   the largest urban area in the world spanning 
over 160 km. You are so incredibly big,   filled with so much complexity, so many 
different moving parts. Or are you just a   cell, in the human civilization 
superstructure? Are you both? Our steps are getting larger and larger now. Germany is around 875 km from North to South 
and the 4th biggest agricultural exporter in the   world. Rhizobia is a nitrogen-fixing bacteria up 
to 3 micrometers long and without it, that sort of   agricultural production is impossible. So we have 
a country and a bacterium depending on each other,   and you are in the middle, both being roughly 
550,000 times larger or smaller than you. What about the whole Earth? It’s 
about 12,700 km in diameter;   about 7.7 million times larger than you. On 
the other side of the scale is Corynebacterium,   as little as 0.3 micrometers across, living 
on your skin and eyes along with 100 billion   other bacteria. More than ten times 
more than there are humans on earth. Again you are in the center. Right 
in the middle of something so large   that our civilization is a mere scratch on its 
surface, and something so small and numerous you   never notice its presence even as it touches 
you. Does that make you feel small, or big? From here on out, your brain is breaking a bit. 4 times wider than Earth is Neptune, a 
cold blue gas giant 49,500 km wide. The   largest planet though is Jupiter, 140,000 
km in diameter. A titanic abyss shrouded   in terrible winds. You could drop Earth whole 
into its depths and it would simply vanish. On the opposite scale we find 
the deadly West Nile virus,   50 nanometers in diameter. Or one step down, 
the spike proteins on a coronavirus, that open   up cells for its RNA payload – they are as small 
to you as you are to the planet Jupiter. You are   in the middle between gigantic planets and the 
world of viruses. These tiny things. So deadly. Let that sink in – a tiny virus is 
taking over and killing lung cells   up to 500 times larger than itself, with 
the help of a tiny protein weapon. That is   like you trying to kill a giant the size 
of the Burj Khalifa with a screwdriver. But the real boss of the Solar System is the Sun. 
Ten times bigger than Jupiter, a billion times   larger than you, controlling all the planets 
and source of all energy that drives life.  A billion times smaller than you, clearly 
the boss of our body is a DNA strand,   containing all the information making 
your life possible. You’re right in the   middle between the most important 
factors keeping everything alive. From here on on things just 
kind of stop making sense.   A billion is already too much but now 
everything just seems to mean ‘a lot’. The supermassive black hole at the 
center of our galaxy, Sagittarius A*,   is 14.5 billion times bigger than you. 
A hydrogen atom is 15.5 billion times   smaller than you. Yeah ok sure. But the 
thing is, we are not even close to being   done and it's not impossible to get 
at least a sense of how these scale. The solar system is 22 trillion times larger 
than you – On the other end of the scale is the   wavelength of low energy neutrinos released 
from fusion reactions in our Sun – about   a hundred trillion of them are passing through 
you every single second, like ghosts a trillion   times smaller than you, basically never hitting 
any of the particles inside you. If you moved   through the solar system in a straight line 
you probably wouldn't hit anything either. Although things are beginning 
to get really weird now. A single proton at the heart of the 
hydrogen atom is almost exactly 1   quadrillion times smaller than you. 
If the proton were as big as you,   the hydrogen atoms would be 
taller than twelve Mt. Everests. On the other end, we meet something that 
just breaks human brains: the incredible   vastness of space, we just have no reference 
for these distances at all. The distance to   the closest star to earth, Alpha Centauri, is 
not 1 quadrillion times in the other direction   from the tiny proton – but 24 quadrillion. 
Space is just so large it is kind of mean. And it goes on like this. A quintillion times smaller than you is the 
strange world of the quarks. The proton is   not actually like a tiny ball but kind of 
just a ripple on the surface of the ocean   of quarks. Every moment, countless quarks pop into 
existence, along with their anti-particle enemies,   before doing furious battle and annihilating each 
other in an instant. How many? Impossible to say,   because the harder you look for them 
the more quarks seem to appear. We’re   simplifying so much it’s like a lie anyway. 
However we choose to illustrate this,   it's wrong. What actually is a quark, what 
does it look like to human minds? Nobody knows. As you sit here, confused, let’s look up 
again. The ocean of quarks in a proton,   inside a single atom of a single 
cell of your body is as small to you,   as you are compared to a sphere around 174 light 
years across, containing about 16 thousand stars. And this is just a tiny speck of dust 
to our galaxy. The Milky Way is close   to one sextillion times larger 
than you. At the opposite end,   we have particles a sextillion 
times smaller than yourself;   like the wavelength of high energy neutrinos 
released when cosmic rays hit our atmosphere. We are getting to the end. The Observable Universe is 93 billion lightyears 
in diameter. Close to a billion billion billion   human lengths. But it’s still finite. It’s 
‘only’ 465,000 Milky Ways side by side. If   you were the size of our galaxy, the observable 
Universe would only be a day’s drive across. On the other end of that scale, we have 
the tiniest particle ever detected,   a proton travelling so close to the 
speed of light it got squished into a   pancake. As small compared to you as the 
whole Observable Universe is big to you. We are at the border of things that we have 
evidence for – are you truly in the middle   of everything? The theoretical smallest 
physical distance is the Planck length,   a hundred million times smaller than even the 
pancake proton. But we don’t know if it's real,   only that our theories of the universe 
break down here. Likewise on the other end,   does the bigness of the universe match 
the smallness of the Planck length? Well,   actually the universe could be considerably 
larger than that. But we will never know. Let’s go back and look at the dimensions again.   There are so many big things and so 
many small things wrapped up in them.   The universe seems to be exactly the 
right size – with you in the middle. How do you try to get it exactly right, 
say when you have to make a big choice   like buying a new mattress? You probably 
compare trustworthy reviews and test out   a few models. But what if you plan to spend 
money on something you can’t just return to   the seller – and the decision doesn’t 
just affect your aching back? GiveWell   is an independent and rigorous resource for

nGggU-Cxhv0,2023-12-12T15:00:01.000000,Your Tattoo is INSIDE Your Immune System. Literally,"Your tattoos are inside your immune system, 
literally. With each very tasteful piece of art,   you kick start a drama with millions of deaths,   grand sacrifices and your immune system 
stepping in to protect you from yourself.   Let's give you a tattoo and zoom in 
to see what happens inside your skin. The Conveyor Belt of Death Your skin has to solve a huge problem – it's your 
largest organ and has the most direct contact with   the world around you. Trillions of microbes, dirt, 
insects and vermin can’t be allowed to get inside you – but your skin is also constantly 
damaged by you moving through the world. Your body solved this by making your skin a 
conveyor belt of death. All the skin you see   is actually dead stuff. The alive part of your 
skin cells begins around one millimeter deep,   in the skin industrial complex. Stem cells 
constantly clone themselves producing new   skin cells that begin a journey 
from the inside to the outside. Each new generation pushes the older ones 
further up. As your skin cells mature,   they interlock with each other and produce 
Lamellar bodies, tiny bags that squirt out   fat to create a waterproof coat that 
closes any gaps between them.  And then,  they dry out and kill themselves, 
merging together into inseparable lumps. This wall of dead corpses is consistently 
pushed upwards. Up to 50 layers of dead   cells cover your whole body and are constantly 
replaced by new cells moving up. Every hour,   you shed around 200,000,000 dead skin cells and 
all the dirt or bacteria that are stuck to them. Tattooing this part of your skin would be   useless as nothing would stick 
around. We need to go deeper. When the Fleshy World Explodes Below the conveyor belt of death lies the 
dermis. It's full of structural tissue and cells,   tiny blood vessels, sensory cells that report 
to nerve endings, the roots of your hairs,   sweat glands regulating your temperature. 
And of course loads of immune cells,   guarding your flesh right 
below the moving border wall. This region and below is where 
your new tattoo will go. Ok! Ready? The world explodes. Half a dozen monoliths 
the size of skyscrapers slam through the fifty   layers of dead cells, deep into the dermis, 
ripping huge holes into the skin – only to   retreat and smash through the tissue again 
about twice a second. Tens of thousands   of cells are violently killed right away, 
ripped into pieces or damaged beyond repair. Luckily, you did your research and chose 
a responsible tattoo artist who properly   disinfected their tools and your skin. But 
you only ever get 99.9% of all bacteria,   and some of the survivors made it into your flesh.  To put it mildly, your immune system is not 
amused at all! All the death and destruction   wakes up hundreds of thousands of Macrophages in 
your dermis, that rush into the open wounds to   defend you. Immediately they start killing 
bacteria, release chemicals that call for   reinforcements and order your blood vessels to 
open up and make your dermis swell up with fluid. But worse than the hundreds of wounds 
and a few invaders is the tidal wave   of chemicals that floods your tissue. Tattoo 
ink can be made from hundreds of substances,   some may even be toxic or carcinogenic. 
Most are from heavy metals like lead,   nickel or chromium dissolved in distilled water. The battlefield is now a wild mix of 
dead cell parts, a few panicked bacteria,   blood and bodily fluids, platelet 
cells trying to close wounds,   more and more fresh immune cells 
and the flood of tattoo ink. On the scale of your cells, clumps of 
ink particles are huge – if you were   the size of a cell, they’d range from 
big dogs to small office buildings. Your immune system has one main job: Identify 
what is not you and smash it until it's dead.   The Macrophages are desperately 
trying to do that. Like tiny octopuses,   they extend arm-like structures and begin 
pulling the ink particles inside. Usually,   when a Macrophage has eaten an enemy, it showers 
it in acid to dissolve it. But this doesn’t work   with the ink. They try and try but nothing 
works, the particles don't react in any way. And this is just the particles 
small enough to be devoured. By now the larger chunks are surrounded 
by thousands of your structural skin cells and macrophages that are nomming on them, 
bathing them in acid and attack chemicals   trying to destroy and kill them. But 
they are not moving even a tiny bit. Nothing works! Finally your immune system has to concede. It 
will not win this fight – so it does the next   best thing: Not lose. Your cells don’t know 
how dangerous these metals and chemicals are,   but they can at least not let them spread 
around. So they just stay in place. They   vacuum up all the particles they can fit 
into their bodies and surround the larger   ones trapping them in the only prison they can 
build: themselves. Bit by bit, the ink inside   thousands of tiny wounds moves inside millions 
of immune cells that freeze in place forever. On the outside you don’t notice any of 
this. Your new tattoo is fresh and the   colours vibrant. Your skin hurts and is 
irritated and swollen. But wounds heal,   tiny holes close, dead cells are replaced. Bit 
by bit, the conveyor belt of death does its job,   shedding dead cells ripe in colour, replacing 
them with fresh and clean ones. Your tattoo   becomes a little less vibrant, now the ink 
is no longer on your skin but inside it. But what you are really seeing 
is millions of your Macrophages,   sitting in your dermis, patiently holding 
the ink in place, protecting your body   from poison. Your immune system 
is why your tattoo is forever. Actually Nothing is Forever Over time your Macrophages get old and die 
and new ones come in to gobble up the ink   and keep it in place. But sometimes 
a tiny bit of ink escapes. Most of it is recaptured and locked in place, 
but not always the exact same place. You notice that as your tattoo fades out a bit 
and turns less sharp and crisp at its edges.   Some of the ink escapes the tattoo entirely. 
It rides fluids flowing from your tissue   and spreads around your body, another reason 
why tattoo ink should ideally not be poison. Your immune system also kind of doesn’t want 
you to remove tattoos – to do that usually the   ink is shot at with lasers, which heats up the 
particles until they break into smaller chunks,   cooking your brave Macrophages in the 
process. With every round of lasering,   more of your tattoo is broken down and 
carried away by fluids. But also every time new Macrophages rush into the tattoo 
to lock the ink in place. So like uhm,   maybe think about it carefully before you get the 
name of your new bae tattooed, but you do you. But if you got one, you can directly see 
your immune system protecting you. This   is how much your body loves you, which 
is kind of sweet. And while tattoos are   probably not that big of a deal for your 
body if applied correctly: you now know   about the struggle going on inside your skin 
and the sacrifice of your Macrophage buddies,   only for you to have that art forever. To appreciate your amazing immune system,   you have to know about it first – and the same 
goes for anything going on in our universe. To help you with that, we’ve created a series 
of lessons to take your scientific knowledge to   the next level. Made in collaboration 
with our friends at Brilliant.org,   these lessons let you further explore 
the topics in our most popular videos,   from rabies and mammalian metabolism to climate 
science and supernovae. Brilliant has thousands of   lessons to explore. And each one is interactive,

HR2C_7G_yRQ,2023-12-08T15:00:01.000000,How To Destroy The Universe,"The universe is going to die one day. But how?  Well, it turns out, our cosmic fate will 
be decided by a fight between two titans. The Two Warriors Deciding the Fate of the Universe Our universe was born 14 billion years ago 
in the Big Bang and has been expanding ever   since. For some reason, new empty space 
is being created out of nothing between   galaxies. Space itself is becoming bigger. 
Will it go on forever, or will it stop one   day? Today we think the universe is at the mercy 
of two cosmic demigods fighting for dominance. The first one is all the stuff in the universe:   galaxies, gas, dark matter. While they are 
very different they just want to do one thing: get together. Matter is attracted by matter, 
pulled together by gravity. And gravity also   pulls on the universe as a whole, slowing 
the expansion that started at the Big Bang. Our second warrior is empty space. While 
it seems, well, empty and powerless,   empty space has an intrinsic energy. We don’t 
really have an idea what this energy is or   why it is there. It’s really a placeholder 
that fills a blank in our understanding of   reality. But it’s got a cool name: dark 
energy. Dark energy pushes things apart,   a sort of “anti-gravity” that 
accelerates the cosmic expansion.
  So we have all the matter in the universe, pulling 
in, and empty space infused with dark energy,   pushing out. Whoever wins will kill the 
universe in fun ways. But who will win? It all depends on the mysterious dark energy:   Will its strength stay the same – a 
common assumption just because it keeps   our models simple? Or will it get weaker, 
or will it get more powerful over time? 1. Constant Dark Energy – Heat Death If the strength of dark energy stays constant, it 
will win the war. Since space is growing, matter   is getting more and more diluted, like sugar 
in a cup being filled with more and more tea. But as the universe expands, new empty space 
is created, which brings more dark energy,   which pushes everything apart even 
more , which creates more empty space,   which makes the universe grow even faster. 
A feedback loop that will make the universe   expand at an exponential rate. Every 12 billion 
years or so it will double in diameter – forever. But while dark energy is winning the war,   matter is winning at least one 
battle: At short distances,   it can keep things together. Local galaxy 
bubbles can overcome the push of dark energy. In a few billion years, our local group of 
galaxies will merge into a gigantic ball with   trillions of stars. It will soon become our last 
view of the cosmos. All other galaxies will be   pushed away by the expansion. For us, it will look 
like the rest of the universe is rushing away,   until in a few hundred billion years we won’t 
see other galaxies at all. We will be alone,   surrounded by a seemingly infinite, dark void. In about 100 trillion years, all the stars of 
our supergalaxy will have died out. All gas   that could create new stars has been consumed, 
and no new gas can come in. The galaxy will   be dark and filled with stellar corpses. Over 
quadrillions of years, white dwarfs and neutron   stars will slowly cool until becoming truly dark 
– turning off the last lights of the universe. All structures, big and small, 
will slowly dissolve. One by one,   all dead stars and planets will leave the 
supergalaxy, which slowly dissolves over   sextillions of years. Every object will 
end up on its own, which means that dark   energy takes over again, creating more 
and more empty space between everything. Objects will be so far apart that it will 
be as if each had a universe for itself.   Not much happens anymore, until in a googol 
years, all black holes will have evaporated. In the end, entropy and dark energy won’t 
stop until their job is finished. Over time   spans you might as well call forever, all 
remaining structures might even dissolve   into single particles that will be pushed away 
from each other by an ever growing empty space.   Imagine a whole universe – with just a single, 
lonely particle traveling through nothingness.   This is the final state, the true end. The Big 
Freeze, or Heat Death. A completely featureless,   cold and eternally expanding universe. Nothing 
will ever be able to happen again. Forever. Well that was a bummer! What else could happen? 2. Increasing Dark Energy – Big Rip What if dark energy gets stronger? In 
this case empty space won’t just win   over matter – it will literally rip it to pieces. In the Big Freeze scenario, matter lost 
the war but won some battles. But here   matter wins nothing. Dark energy is growing 
stronger over time, overcoming the pull of   gravity and creating new empty space at smaller 
and smaller distances. In this scenario things   will escalate quickly – it could start 
as early as 20 billion years from now. First, dark energy will create empty space 
between individual galaxies. Our galaxy will   leave its local cluster and begin to drift alone 
in a rapidly inflating and ever darker cosmos. Some billion years later empty space 
starts to push between individual stars,   dissolving the galaxy. If you live on a 
planet in a star system, the night sky   will start looking sad and gloomy, as other 
stars are pushed too far away to be seen. A few million years after the sky turns dark,   dark energy starts to create empty space 
inside star systems. Your planet is pushed   away from its star and all life in the universe 
freezes to death. There is not much time left,   as a few months later dark energy is 
creating empty space inside solid objects. Stars, neutron stars, planets, asteroids, 
everything solid is being ripped into pieces. If you're on a spaceship, you only have a short time 
before you are ripped apart. Half an hour later,   even atoms are destroyed as new space is 
being created so furiously that electrons   and nuclei are separated. Now the universe 
has just a fraction of a second left. In this final moment, only dying black 
holes remain, drained and defeated by   dark energy. They are tiny, septillions 
of times smaller than an atom – and they   explode with the power of a trillion supernovae 
in a trillionth of an octillionth of a second. Finally, the very fabric of reality is torn to its 
core, obliterating spacetime itself. The Big Rip.   Space and time have lost their meanings, making 
it impossible to predict what will happen next. Oof. 3. Decreasing Dark Energy – Big Crunch Poor matter. But there is 
one scenario where it wins:   If the strength of dark energy decreases with 
time, and if this reduction is strong enough,   the pull of gravity will win and 
all the things in existence will   move towards each other – unfortunately 
making the universe collapse into itself. No one knows when this might begin,   but it could be as soon as a few hundred 
million years. What will it look like? As the universe begins to contract, over 
billions of years, galaxies and galaxy   clusters approach each other until they eventually 
collide. They are mostly made of empty space,   so a collision is like the gentle 
merger of two clouds. At any rate,   first galaxies and later individual 
stars get closer and closer. As the universe goes on collapsing, you might 
worry about stars and planets eventually crashing   against each other. This will happen, but it’s 
not your worst problem. If space itself shrinks,   this also concentrates all the radiation emitted 
in the past by all the stars, supernovae and   quasars that ever existed. Now ‘empty’ space is 
filled with radiation, the dark nothing between   stars is heating up, making life unpleasant and 
then impossible as planets just burn. Slowly at   first, then rapidly, space gets as hot as it 
was after the Big Bang. Stars are pretty hot,   but now the space around them is hotter 
–they are literally boiled from the outside. As the universe collapses into 
itself, all galaxies and all   stars merge into a single ball of hot 
plasma – the Big Crunch is complete. From here on there are two possibilities. 
Either the universe will collapse completely   into a singularity, a point of zero size and 
infinite density, without space and time.   The way it might have been before the Big 
Bang. Or the universe could “bounce back”,   restarting the cosmic expansion, creating a 
new baby universe. Somewhat poetic really,   everything died, but everything 
is reborn. But to be clear,   we have zero evidence that this has 
happened before or will in the future. So What Will Happen? Most scientists think that dark energy will 
stay constant, so the likely fate of the   universe is Heat Death – eternal cold and utter 
boredom. Which seems sad but has a huge upside:   In this scenario we get to have the universe for 
the longest. It gives us trillions of years to   expand, jump from star to star, maybe even 
from galaxy to galaxy. We might even find a   way to keep consciousness around forever. We 
don’t know. So we just have to wait and see,   and make the most of the amazing 
universe we have right now."
yDMZJ7LgrGY,2023-12-05T16:30:09.000000,The Moment Kurzgesagt Changed Forever,"Hey you, so nice of you to join 
us! We want to tell you about   something that changed kurzgesagt forever.
Kurzgesagt started out as a small-scale   passion project. But creating animated 
science videos that are free for everyone,   doesn’t pay the bills – DAMN YOU reality! 
In order to make ends meet we had to take   on “real jobs” during the day and create 
kurzgesagt videos at night. It was tough   but our dream of inspiring people 
all around the world kept us going. Then in 2016 everything changed.
Kurzgesagt’s founder, Philipp Dettmer   had an idea. He wanted to create something 
inspiring that would extend beyond the   digital YouTube cosmos. Something tangible.
Something that would represent kurzgesagt’s   view of the world and our belief in 
humanity’s potential for greatness. His idea: the kurzgesagt Human Era Calendar. 
It establishes a new year zero to include all   people and cultures around the world. This 
new year zero, roughly 12,000 years ago,   signifies a time when humans first started 
working together on a larger scale,   laying the foundation for modern society 
and eventually our future ahead of us. The first Human Era Calendar was a 
huge success, it sold out within a   few hours and inspired thousands of birbs 
around the globe. Every year since then,   we’ve created a new edition of the Human 
Era Calendar – each one more spectacular   and successful than the last. It has 
enabled us to grow our team, improve   our video quality and research standards, and 
still release our videos for free for everyone. This year’s calendar is extra special. 
Join us as we conduct a series of space   experiments to see how they would affect the 
development of life. What would a creature   living near an orange dwarf look like? 
Could life still exist after a supernova   explosion? And what the hell is this?
Join us in 12,024 and find out. And   of course you can also use it to plan 
humanity's next steps towards greatness. To celebrate what may be our most 
glorious calendar yet, we've prepared   a few spectacular limited deals for you.
Thank you so much for being a part of our   story and for coming together every 
year to make all of this possible!"
fuFlMtZmvY0,2023-11-29T15:00:43.000000,The Internet is Worse Than Ever – Now What?,"In 2022 nearly half of Americans expected 
a civil war in the next few years,   one in five now believes political violence 
is justified. And it's not just the US but around the world. People increasingly 
see themselves as part of opposing teams. There are many different reasons 
for this, but one gets blamed a lot:   social media. Social media divides us, 
makes us more extreme and less empathetic,   it riles us up or sucks us into doom scrolling,   making us stressed and depressed. It feels like we 
need to touch grass and escape to the real world. New research shows that we might have 
largely misinterpreted why this is the   case. It turns out that the social media 
internet may uniquely undermine the way   our brains work but not in the way you think. The Myth of the Filter Bubble You've probably heard about online filter bubbles: 
Algorithms give you exactly what you want, or what   they think you want. You only see information 
that shows you opinions that agree with yours,   while dissenting opinions or information are 
filtered out. Since you only see content close to   your world view, more extreme and toxic opinions 
suddenly seem less extreme. You are trapped in a   radicalising filter bubble and your view of 
the world becomes narrower and more extreme. But is that true? Extreme filter bubbles seem to be rather rare  Studies that investigated what people actually 
look at online or are shown by search engines,   found little evidence that you are ideologically 
isolated. It is the exact opposite: Online you   are constantly confronted with opinions 
and world views that are not your own. It turns out the place where you are the most 
ideologically isolated is your real life,   in the real world, with real people. Your 
real world interactions with your friends,   family, colleagues and neighbors are 
much less diverse than your online   bubble. The filter bubble exists 
in your real life, not online.  Ok wait. Online filter bubbles have been 
the prevailing explanation as to why we’ve   all started hating each other more over the 
last two decades. If that's not the case,   shouldn’t the internet open our minds and 
make us more empathetic with each other? Unfortunately your brain is stupid. Your Brain is Stupid Human brains didn’t evolve to understand the true 
nature of reality, but to navigate and maintain   social structures. Our ancestors desperately 
needed each other to survive, so our brains   had to make sure we cooperated. That's why social 
isolation or exclusion feels so horrible, because   it was actually life threatening. A tribe that 
worked together survived, a divided tribe died. The way communities worked for 
thousands of years is that, sure,   you may have disliked a neighbour, but because 
you lived close to each other, you also rooted   for the same sports club or saw them at the
church. You both thought that the people from   the other village were idiots. Being physically 
close made you familiar and created similarities   that bridged the gap of different world views so 
you didn’t murder each other. And your world view   was probably not that different in the first place 
because it was formed by the same local culture. When our brains evolved, this was enough. Whoever 
was around, was similar to us. We liked what was   similar to us – this kept us aligned enough 
to work together despite our differences.  As humanity moved on from small tribes to towns 
and cities, from chiefdoms to kingdoms to nations,   our brains and our communities had to adapt to 
more diverse sets of neighbours. We began to meet   on the town square or in universities 
where we argued and screamed at each   other – but in the grand scheme of things 
communities were still relatively isolated,   we were still pretty similar and 
aligned with the people around us. Conflict and disagreement are not 
a bad thing per se. Tension over   how we should live can create new 
and wonderful things. Our values,   norms and taboos are always evolving 
and whatever we think is normal today,   will not be normal in the future. But we also 
need social glue to hold our societies together,   because our brains don’t care about the meta 
level of humanity but about being safe in a tribe. Until about 20 years ago 
we did something truly new,   that hit our brains like a freight train: the 
social media internet, the digital town square. Don’t You Dare Disagree With Me – Social Sorting In a nutshell: Our brains are not able 
to process the amount of disagreement we   encounter on the social internet. The very 
mechanisms that made it possible for our   ancestors to work together in the first place 
are derailed in ways we were not prepared for. Whether you want it to or not, your brain 
sorts people by world views and opinions,   into teams. This is not simply tribalism,   it goes further. Researchers have 
called this process social sorting. On the digital town square you encounter people 
that express opinions or share information   that clash with your worldview. But unlike your 
neighbour, they don't root for your local sports   club. You are missing the local social glue your 
brain needs to align with them. For your brain,   the disagreement between yourself and them 
becomes a central part of their identity.  And this makes it less likely that 
you will seriously consider their   position or opinion in the future. 
If you hear bad things about them,   your brain is much more likely 
to believe it uncritically. On the flipside, there are people who 
share your world view and are maybe   even more similar to you than many people 
in your real life. Which makes your brain   like them a lot and kind of hyper align with 
them. People who think like you are probably   good people because you are a good person and 
whatever social group you belong to is good!   So your brain is more likely to believe their 
opinions. If you hear bad things about them,   your brain is much more likely 
to dismiss it uncritically. The engagement driven social internet makes it 
worse because it wants to keep you online as   long as possible. And the most engaging emotion 
is, unfortunately: Anger. The more angry you get,   the more likely you are to share and engage, 
and this leads to social media amplifying the   most extreme and controversial opinions. It 
optimises not only to show us disagreement,   but the worst disagreement possible. And because 
your stupid brain is sorting people into teams,   whatever the worst opinions are, it assigns the 
same opinions to everybody on the other team. What is striking and new about online polarisation 
is that all the aspects of our lives that make   us individuals, our lifestyle choices, the 
comedians or shows we watch, our religion,   sense of fashion and so on are condensed, 
making it seem that they are parts of   opposing and mutually exclusive identities.
This simplifies and distorts disagreements about how we should run society so much that 
it often seems as if the people on the other   team are actively, willfully making the 
world worse. That they are almost evil,   beyond convincing with rationality, facts or civil 
discussion. While you are of course on the correct   team, it may be hard to process that you may 
seem like that to people on the other team. On a societal level this is dissolving the 
social glue that is the foundation of our   democracies. If we think our neighbours 
are evil, how can we live together? This is especially bad in the US, where the 
two party system makes it extra easy to think   of people in terms of teams – negative opinion 
about the other party has reached record highs. Ok. Is there something we can learn 
from this? Is there something we can do? Something more positive – Opinion Part In the end, It is important to be 
aware of what social media does to   your brain. It's easier to change 
yourself than to change the world,   so you can self examine why you believe the 
things you believe and whether you dismiss   or believe information based on who the 
person is who is stating that information. The internet comes with a lot of 
ups and downs and just like we   had to adapt from living in small tribes 
to living in cities, we need to adapt to   the information age where we have access to 
billions of people. Evolution is too slow,   so we need to find models that work with 
what our brains are able to tolerate. One model that seemed to work well was the pre 
social media internet old people might remember: Bulletin boards, forums, blogs. The 
main difference to today was twofold:   For one there were no algorithms fighting to 
keep you online at anycost – at some point   you were done with the internet for the 
day, as mind blowing as this may sound. But more importantly: The old internet 
was very fractured, split into thousands   of different communities, like small villages 
gathering around shared beliefs and interests.   These villages were separated from each 
other by digital rivers or mountains. These communities worked because they mirrored 
real life much more than social media:   Each village had its own culture and set of rules. 
Maybe one community was into rough humour and soft   moderation, another had strict rules and banned 
easily. If you didn’t play by the village rules,   you would be banned – or you could just go and 
move to another village that suited you better. So instead of all of us gathering in one 
place, overwhelming our brains at a town   square that in the end just leads to us 
going insane, one solution to achieve less   social sorting may be extremely simple: 
go back to smaller online communities. Because what our stupid brains don’t realize 
is that we are actually all on the same team:   Humanity, on a wet rock speeding through space 
in a universe that doesn’t think about us.   We are all in this together – but until our 
brains adjust to being able to deal with that,   we might be better off being a tiny bit separated. One of the worst things about the media we 
consume is that most news organizations tend   to cater to one team, making you 
feel you are on the correct side.  Ground News, the sponsor of this video, is 
trying to make these biases more transparent   by giving you tools that help you think 
critically about the information you   consume – a mission we wholeheartedly

even the ones he hated, front to back,   every single day. Aside from the obvious biases, 
what was the most shocking were the stories   each side did not talk about. Both sides ignored

FgnjdW-x7mQ,2023-11-21T15:00:01.000000,The Last Thing To Ever Happen In The Universe,"The universe today is happy and healthy, 
 with exciting things going on. But at some point the night will turn 
dark. Everything that once was  will peacefully sleep forever. But what 
is the last thing that will ever happen   and when will it be? It turns out there 
is such a thing and you probably haven’t   heard about it. Let's travel to the end of 
the universe and look at the last thing. After a messy birth our universe was a sleepy 
baby, warm and dark, filled with swirling clouds   of hot hydrogen and helium. The story of creation 
is a story of this gas and where it will end up. Shortly after, the universe got busy making 
the first generation of stars. They were   massive and lived violent lives, forging new 
elements, only to release most of them when   they blew up. Countless stars were born and 
refined the gas available in the universe,   cycling matter around, each generation giving 
most of its gas and fresh elements to the next. But not all gas is returned. Every time a 
new generation of stars forms, they also   make more and more red dwarfs that burn slowly 
and live for trillions of years. When they die,   they don’t give their gas back to the universe 
but turn into white dwarfs. So red dwarfs lock   up more gas forever. Some more gas is locked 
forever in other remains of dead stars:   neutron stars and black holes. Which is bad, as 
it reduces the material available for new stars. Today the universe is a great 
home for us and will remain so   for billions of years. But most of 
the gas has been used up or trapped.   Over 90% of the stars that will 
ever be born have been born already. To get to the last thing to ever happen, 
all other things need to happen first. The next few hundred billion years 
will be fun and a great time for   galactic exploration – but step by 
step, large stars and stars like   our sun will die out. Eventually almost all 
the stars will be red dwarfs slowly dying. The End of Everything – but not quite In a few trillion years the 
cosmic gas will finally have   run out. About 88% of the mass of 
every galaxy will be white dwarfs,   2% neutron stars and black holes, and about 
10% gas giants and sad brown dwarf losers. White dwarfs are the corpses of old stars, not 
much bigger than earth but on average as massive   as half our sun, some even much more. This makes 
them the third densest objects in the universe,   after neutron stars and black holes. 
About a 1,000,000 times denser than   the sun today. Since they used to be active 
stars, their surface can be as hot as 150,000   degrees. White dwarfs are dim, hot, dense 
spheres that don’t do anything anymore. But eventually even white dwarfs will die because 
they are slowly losing their heat – it takes at   least 10 trillion years, more than 700 times 
longer than the current age of the universe.   As they do their cooling down, the universe 
around them will irreversibly grow dark,   as more and more white dwarfs burn 
out, and turn into dead husks:   black dwarfs. Spheres of death, as cold as space 
itself, invisible against the dark backdrop. Over trillions and trillions of years,   every object in every galaxy is 
eventually either ejected into   the void or its orbit decays and it will fall 
into the central black hole and be destroyed. In about a quintillion years, all galaxies 
have evaporated and every object is on its own,   in the center of its own observable universe, 
emptiness as far as can be seen in any direction,   traveling through black nothingness. 
Still, there are things that will happen. Black holes are dying. Slowly. They’ll fizzle 
away by emitting Hawking radiation until they   are so small that they die in a final flash 
of light. This will take about a googol years,   10 to the power of 100 years, until the last 
super massive black hole dies. A number so absurd,   there is nothing to compare it to. 
Maybe some living beings could have   survived around black holes – but even 
this science fiction option ends now. After this unsettling amount of time we are not 
even close to the end. Now is the time of the   black dwarfs. It turns out there is some weird 
physics going on inside the dead husk of stars! The Weird Physics of Black Dwarfs A black dwarf is a sphere the size of earth, 
as massive as a star but almost as cold as   absolute zero. Stars stay alive because 
their intense heat in their cores – so   why do black dwarfs not collapse into 
a black hole? What keeps them together? Deep inside a black dwarf, matter is squeezed 
to densities millions of times greater than   anything we see on earth. The pressure is so great 
that electrons can’t combine with nuclei to form   atoms. Instead matter is weird, degenerate: the 
nuclei are compressed by the weight of the star,   locked into a rigid lattice, while the 
electrons form a plasma between them. And these electrons hold the star 
together. We are simplifying,   but imagine matter as a subway train 
and electrons as passengers. If there   are empty seats passengers spread out because 
they care a lot about their personal space. But as a black dwarf is so incredibly 
dense, this is like squishing more and   more passengers into our train. Gravity 
is pushing in, trying to collapse it. The   Passengers are forced to sit and stand 
close together, which they hate. And so   the passengers, our electrons try to push 
out against gravity as hard as they can. This way the electrons that are having a horrible 
time in the crowded train that is the black dwarf,   hold up the star. Everything else in 
the universe may have crumbled already,   these tiny particles push against each other 
until the end of time. Or they would – if  quantum mechanics didn’t ruin everything. Simplifying a lot: when particles get close 
enough, sometimes they can jump at each other   and fuse together. A process called ‘quantum 
tunneling’. This happens constantly in stars   because of their intense heat. It is one of the 
key reasons stars can fuse elements into new   ones. But it also happens at a temperature near 
absolute zero. Just, well, mind numbingly slowly. This is the final step to creating the last 
interesting thing to ever happen in our universe. Here, in this lone black dwarf something fantastic 
occurs. Nothing happens for a trillion years.   Nothing at all. Can you imagine that? But 
then! A single fusion reaction: two carbon   nuclei combine by quantum tunneling to become 
magnesium! Another 100 trillion years pass. It   happens again! Then nothing for another bazillion 
years. Oh! Two oxygen nuclei combine into silicon! As eons pass, the nuclei in the frozen black 
dwarf slowly combine. Making new heavier   nuclei. And these take even longer to fuse, 
but given enough time they eventually will. Remember the breathtaking amount of time 
it took for a supermassive black hole to   evaporate? That's a brief moment in 
comparison to what's going on here. The difference between a second and 
trillions of years has lost all meaning.   Over a time so absurd that it has no name, 
nuclei keep fusing into heavier elements. Until, when silicon nuclei fuse, they 
form Nickel-56. Nickel-56 is radioactive,   which means it is unstable. And when it 
eventually decays and turns into iron,   it emits two positrons – antimatter electrons. And these two positrons,   find two electrons and annihilate them 
and themselves. Which is a problem. Remember how the uncomfortable electrons 
produce the pressure to hold the star   together? Destroying the electron means 
fewer friends to help them hold up the   star. Losing an electron does not give 
them more space to scratch their butts,   it just makes gravity squeeze harder, the 
walls closing in on those that remain. In the case of the most massive black 
dwarfs this is catastrophic. Bit by bit,   the black dwarf turns into a sphere of 
iron, and more electrons are annihilated. For at least 10^1000 years – almost, 
but not quite forever – there is   no visible change in the entire universe.
And then, finally, the last thing to ever   happen happens. The black dwarf has lost 
one too many electrons. It can no longer   support its immense mass and goes into 
an uncontrolled collapse - a supernova. It first implodes and then explodes 
as bright as a galaxy and fills the   empty universe with light again! A beautiful 
moment nobody will get to enjoy. And then,   as quickly as it began, it's all over. Darkness again, emptiness. That was the last thing that will ever happen. 
The universe may now be truly dead. But don’t be bummed out about it. This is so far 
away in the future that “forever” hardly describes it. Today the universe is the best place it 
could be for us. And you can sleep tight tonight,   knowing the last interesting thing that 
will ever happen is forever long away. For now, there are still plenty of interesting 
things to discover - and the younger you start   discovering, the more you will understand 
about the world we live in. Our sponsor   KiwiCo helps kids get a headstart there
 with a range of unique crates on a   myriad of STEM topics, covering science, 
technology, engineering, arts and math. Every crate is like a little adventure 
in a box. Imagine the excitement of a   trip to the museum or an amazing theme 
park – but delivered to your doorstep,   with everything you need neatly packed inside.
There are different lines designed for kids   of all ages and interests so 
there’s something for everyone. Like us, KiwiCo spends a ridiculous amount of 
time on fine tuning each crate - every one of   their 2000 available projects took more than 
one thousand hours to develop by experts and   is tested by kids. We really liked the 
KiwiCo Tinker crate line which gives   you a hands-on engineering project with 
all of the educational and instructional   information you need to complete the project 
at home – we might also have decided to just   keep some of them around the office and 
not hand the extras to any kids we know. If you want to try out KiwiCo and get the best 
deal, click on the link in the infobox or use   the code KURZGESAGT to get 50% off your first 
month. Or if you want to try it out first,   they also offer individual crates in 
the KiwiCo Store. At kurzgesagt we   love to spark curiosity – and we love to work
with companies that share this goal."
tybKnGZRwcU,2023-11-15T15:00:01.000000,How to Win an Interstellar War,"Could aliens destroy us
from light years away? Mh, another day at the Kurzgesagt Labs, where we answer the most important
questions with science. Today: how might civilizations wage war
across light years? What kind of devastating weapons
could they use, and what would they look like? Meet our two players. A yellow dwarf star system
home to a species of primates. ""Humans,"" as they call themselves, recently became
a technological civilization. They have rockets,
nuclear reactors and memes. How cute! The Smorpians disagree. They reside on a planet around
the orange dwarf star HD 40307, 42 light years away. Smorpian civilization
developed earlier than humans and they have much better technology. They've recently built
a Dyson swarm around their star which gives them near limitless energy. And they noticed humanity, which is unfortunate as the Smorpians
are planning a hyperspace bypass through our solar system, so they decided that humanity has to go. Interstellar war is hard though. Front lines, tactics, and logistics
are meaningless at these scales. It's also fought across time. Decades will pass
between firing a weapon and learning whether it hit or not. Sending an invasion fleet is futile. Even if the Smorpians travel
in a large fraction of the speed of light, the journey to Earth would take
decades or even centuries, and humans would have
plenty of time to prepare. If you want to learn more
about the mind numbing problem of war between alien civilizations, we made a video about it. Today we'll help the Smorpians
construct a weapon that is not only extremely long range
and as fast as physically possible, but that will totally destroy
everything on Earth, so no human survivors will come to an act
of vengeance on swap in the future. In interstellar war,
you want to win with one shot. Our bird scientists have found
three Smorpian designs: the Star Laser, the Relativistic Missile, and the Ultra-Relativistic Electron Beam. All based on real technologies that humans are using
in some form already. Let's see how they work. [The Star Laser] As an advanced technological civilization, the Smorpians harness
the energy of their star by surrounding it with billions
of solar power satellites. This Dyson swarm collects 1%
of the star's energy output, a million billion billion watts, 50 billion times more
than all humanity generates. What if all the power
of the Dyson swarm, all those satellites were used
to create a star laser? Like any laser, the bigger it is,
the longer its range. Human-built lasers
use small mirrors to focus, so they have short ranges. The Smorpians could turn
their entire Dyson swarm into a collective focusing element
a million kilometers wide. The star laser has an insane
range as a result, enough to focus on target Earth from a distance of over
2 million light years. OK, let's shoot it. Countless tiny beams combine
into a single huge beam. Laser beams are normally
invisible in space, but the star laser is so powerful that light scattering off bits
of dust and gas in its path makes it clearly visible in the sky. A gigantic column of green light. The laser travels at the speed of light, which, oddly enough,
is still pretty slow on a galactic level. It takes a whole day until the laser
has left the Smorpian system, shooting into the emptiness between stars. It will travel for decades, occasionally melting the odd bit
of interstellar dust or asteroid. 42 years after being fired,
it arrives without warning. Humans only notice
a weird green glow in the sky, and then they're gone. 1% of the energy of a star, concentrated into a beam
the diameter of Earth, traveling 42 light years. It burns the exposed half of the planet with the intensity of 3 million Suns. The seas boil and evaporate,
fires scour the land, and within minutes Earth's crust
begins to melt into a sea of lava. As the planet rotates, it turns into a red hot hell
with no trace of life. After a day, it's all over
and the laser dies down. In another 42 years, the Smorpians will know
if they've been successful. That's another thing
about interstellar war. When you attack, your grandchildren
will be the ones to find out if you won. It's like all the bombs from World War II
exploding in the 80s and us only seeing the effect today. OK, the star laser's extreme range,
speed of light attack, and ability to melt down any target make it a premier interstellar weapon. But is there something else? [The Relativistic Missile] What if instead of converting the energy
of their Dyson swarm into a laser, the Smorpians used it
to shoot a super bullet? A relativistic missile going as close
to the speed of light as possible. This sort of weapon is at the limits of what the Smorpian
technology can handle, as it requires loads of a highly
dangerous material: antimatter. The evil twin of regular matter. Humans have only managed to produce
a few nanograms of antimatter. With their unlimited energy, Smorpians can manufacture it
at an industrial scale to build antimatter rockets. When antimatter and matter are mixed,
they annihilate, which in more practical terms
means there's a big big boom releasing gamma rays and plasma. The physics is complicated, but basically, if you have
a really strong magnetic field you can deflect the plasma
through a nozzle just like in the chemical rockets
humans use. But it would be much, much faster. The fastest rocket possibly basically. Our relativistic missile
is much bigger than a skyscraper. At the bottom is the bell shaped
magnetic nozzle 100 meters wide. On top of it are 250 floors
filled with antimatter and matter ready to annihilate each other. On the top floor
is a 300 kilogram projectile looking quite small,
about the size of a person. To stop them getting damaged on the way, the missiles have dozens
of sacrificial layers that form a Whipple Shield. To make sure they do their job, the Smorpians build 1000 missiles. Let's fire them. Launching all the relativistic missiles
is a spectacular event. For a moment, the antimatter engines
lighting up outshine their star. Their exhaust is a long trail
of brilliant white, and as they accelerate away, they appear redder and redder
until they turn invisible. With the extreme amount of energy released
by the matter-antimatter reactions, the missiles are accelerated to 99.9999996%
of the speed of light. They have effectively infinite range, as there's nothing really
to slow them down. They arrive shortly
after you can see them. The light from their launch
will take 42 years to reach Earth, so human astronomers might see
the flash of the missile's launch, and then a few days later they'll hit. Not enough time to prepare. Each relativistic missile
packs the kinetic energy of a dinosaur killer asteroid, so only one needs to hit. They never reach the ground, disintegrating instead
at the edge of Earth's atmosphere. Intense blue flashes
set everything on fire. Then continent-sized fireballs
slam down on the surface to smash everything into dust, repeatedly, until nothing is left
but rubble and smoke. So interstellar missiles
with unlimited range, minimal warning, and delivering complete
destruction of a planet's surface. Nice. But they are a hassle to build. Is there something else maybe? [The Ultra-Relativistic Electron Beam] Humans do funny things to their food to rid it of bacteria
and make it safe to eat, like shooting electron beams
at strawberries. Small particle accelerators
send electrons into the food with an energy similar to the radiation
from nuclear reactions. Not enough to burn the food,
but deadly to bacteria. Smorpians had the same idea,
but bigger. The main challenge
with an electron beam is range. Electrons are negatively
charged particles, so they don't want to stay
near each other. A regular electron beam
will quickly spread out, making it harmless. Smorpians needed to cover distances
of dozens of light years, so they've used the rules
of the universe to trick the electrons by building an Ultra-Relativistic
Electron Beam, or UREB. What it does is accelerate the electrons to 99.99999… …99999… …99999… …99999… …9999998% of the speed of light. Phew! Faster than even
the most powerful cosmic rays. The closer something travels
to the speed of light, the slower time moves for it
relative to the rest of the universe. And since these electrons
are moving so incredibly fast, for every second of spreading
their experience, over 5 million years pass in real time. A physics trick that lets the beam
cross interstellar distances while remaining
tightly focused on its target. The biggest particle accelerator on Earth
is 27 kilometers long. The Smorpians need one
that's over 100,000 kilometers long. A megastructure 8 times longer
than Earth is wide. It's mostly a tube of magnets holding
the beam together until the exit. Like a long trumpet of doom
surrounded by an aura of deadly radiation. When it's fired, it produces a ruler
straight lightning bolt pointed at Earth. Its effects on arrival are less visible
than the other weapons. No flashes of light,
no massive firestorms, no explosions. It doesn't destroy rocks,
it destroys DNA. People get dizzy, then fall sick
as their cells are pierced by radiation. You might think that a deep bunker
could save a few humans, but no. The UREB is so penetrating that its effects accumulate
to lethal doses even underground, over days or weeks. In the end, just like our strawberries, Earth becomes sterile. [Simulation results] Hm, another elaborate animated
science explainer by Kurzgesagt where we've learned a lot,
not sure exactly what. Luckily, the Smorpians don't really exist, but others… might. One major downside of all our weapons is that others around the Milky Way
could see you firing them, which is not ideal because you don't want to present
yourself as a dangerous species and tell everybody where exactly you are. So maybe instead of shouting
or shooting out into the universe, the best course of action seems to be
to stay relatively quiet for now, and observe. Maybe one day we'll witness
distant stars shooting at each other and be glad we stayed out of it."
S7TUe5w6RHo,2023-11-10T16:15:06.000000,4.5 Billion Years in 1 Hour,"Earth is 4.5 billion years old – impossible
for your brain to truly grasp, so here is an experiment: every second around 1.5 million years 
will pass – you're on a musical train ride  looking out the window, passing all of
Earth's History in an hour. Watch the eons pass and experience
how long a billion years really is. You can have this in the background, study
with it or just enjoy the ride. From time to time, I’ll say a few words. 4.5 billion years ago, right after it was
born, Earth was a hell of lava… Pretty early in its history, Earth collides
with a Mars sized object called Theia, which forms the moon that you now see in the sky. Right now it looks huge in the night sky and
will slowly shrink over hundreds of millions of years as it orbits further away. 4.5 Billion Years Ago we are in the first eon of our planet, the Hadean, named after the greek god of the underworld. At this point the Atmosphere is mostly CO2
and the floor is lava. This area of earth's history is mostly invisible
to us because almost none of it is left. 90 million years have passed.  We are still in the lava hell phase. Settle in, this will take a while. Although you wouldn't think it, we found 
minerals called zircons that indicate there may have been some 
water around at this time. During this period of the young solar system,
Earth and the inner solar system are smashed by a constant heavy asteroid bombardment,
for several hundred million years. At this point in time, our Sun is 30% less
bright than it is today but there are so many greenhouse gases that it's 
still much hot and comfy. Around this time we think
life begins to enter the stage. Only a few hundred million years after the
beginning of everything the first cells begin spreading over our still very deadly planet. Earth continues to cool and it probably 
rains for millions of years as our oceans begin to form, covering 
the still young planet with water. These hydrothermal vents we're looking at,
and where hot minerals emerge, may have been the place where life first developed, 
but we dont know. So much time has passed and we are entering
the Paleoarchean. Most of Earth is still underwater while the
first supercontinents are in the making in the depths below. Its days are shorter since the 
young Earth spins faster. Good job if you are still watching. You witnessed a billion years so far. From this time in history we still have Stromatolites,
sedimentary rocks built by microorganisms. Among our first real evidence of life on Earth. Also life is starting to eat the sun – photosynthesis
might have started as early as around here. 3.2 Billion Years Ago in the Mesoarchean the
era of continents begins. Tectonic plates begin to crush into each other,
pulling and pushing some deep into the earth where they dissolve. The basis for our continents today. The oceans are as hot as a hottub, over 40°C
and microbes are expanding everywhere. We don't have plants yet to consume greenhouse
gases, so it is really, really hot. You would basically die immediately 
in this atmosphere. Also there is no oxygen
in the atmosphere yet. 2.8 Billion Years Ago the Neoarchean begins. Earth is still a terribly hostile place but
because we finally have proper plate tectonics, more chemicals are mixed in from inside the
earth and life can use them to make new things! Some time around here Prokaryotes like bacteria
begin colonizing the planet. Life diversifies more and more. But still, after so much time, 
we only have single cells. 2.5 Billion Years Ago in the Siderian, 
a massive event is about to begin that will change the planet forever:
The Great Oxidation Event. Oxygen, burped out by cyanobacteria reaches
the atmosphere in large quantities, paving the way for more complex life. All the new oxygen in the air reacts with
methane and forms CO2 and Water, which rapidly cools the planet down. Probably for the first time ever, the planet
freezes over and a period of multiple ice ages begins lasting millions of years. 2.3 Billion Years Ago the Rhyacian begins. Lots of volcanos heat up earth and 
earth unfreezes slowly again. Melting ice flushes toxic elements into the
oceans but life quietly puts up resistance and keeps evolving. Some time 2.05 Billion Years Ago in the Orosirian
a large asteroid hits earth and creates the largest verified impact structure on Earth. All over Earth great mountain ranges are 
crushed into existence by early continents with wild names like Ur, Nena or Atlantica. 1.8 Billion Years Ago in the Statherian 
the supercontinent Columbia has formed. And a natural, self sustaining
nuclear reactor awakes, just from scattered uranium
deposits in the ground. 1.6 billion years ago, around the edge of
Calimmian, + or - a few hundred million years or so, the first Eukaryotic cells, cells with
a nucleus, merge from two other cells. One of the most important 
moments in the history of life. But yes, kind of looks not that impressive. Still, life is only cells. Earth's crust thickens and heavy continents
form, the oceans become shallower. Also the first fungi-like organisms extent
their tubular arms and do fungi things. Some time in the Ectasian 1.4 Billion Years
Ago, Earths inner core is forming. Weird, right? Feels like it should be older. But around here it begins to solidify into
a iron crystal surrounded by hot liquid metal. It will only grow from now on. 1.2 Billion Years Ago in the Stenian not that
much is going on. Except, the algae Bangiomorpha 
pubescens might have invented sex. A big reproductive improvement 
for many different reasons. 1 Billion Years Ago the Tonian begins, another
age where Earth is rocks and puddles and oceans. Life is still invisible to the naked eye. It does feel different to 
witness it like that, right? Not everybody is having a great time here. We have evidence of the first unicellular
predators emerging around that time. The dominance of bacteria ends and big boy
eukaryotes plant their flags in the oceans. An arms race between microbes begins that
again creates huge diversity. Some even invent tiny armour. 720 Million Years Ago in the Cryogenian 
Earth freezes over again. Sure why not. How did life survive? We are not sure. 635 Million Years Ago the supercontinent 
Gondwana forms. A lot of it is still left today! Wow! What's happening? Suddenly life gets big! In a hot second multicellular 
organisms become widespread! It's all strange aliens still, but can you
imagine that it took that long for this to happen? 539 Million Years Ago the 
Cambrian explosion begins. We see life bursting with variety. Ancestors of almost all of today's major animal
groups appear here while the plants start to discover the land. Life is finally exciting! But of course a big mass extinction happens
right after, killing most species in the ocean. Plants spread over the planet and create the
soil on the ground and change the atmosphere by eating CO2. Things escalate. Flora and fauna adapt better 
and better to life on land. We get trees and forrests, fish and the 
first vertebrate decide this land thing is something they need to try out! 359 Million Years Ago in the Carboniferous
forests and lush marshlands are at their peak. They will turn into the coal humanity burns
today to keep ourselves warm. Its all so fast now! Life changes so quickly
in geological timeframes! Some 299 Million Years Ago in the Permian,
Pangea, the last supercontinent has formed. And after a few tens of million years, the
largest mass extinction in history happens, killing the majority of all species. Thanks volcanoes. 252 Million Years Ago the Triassic begins. Oh hey, a dinosaur! We are now truly in the age of reptiles. Dinosaurs are everywhere! The ancestors of the birds do bird things. Life, uhh, finds a way! Earth gets more and more familiar. Such a paradise. Life is thriving. Nothing can go wrong... wait, what's that? And an asteroid killed the dinosaurs and 
most species on Earth. Such a bummer. 66 Million Years Ago in the Paleogene the continents look roughly the same as today
and mammals take over. It is our time now! We are almost home. Don't blink or you might miss 
all of human history! And that was it. Earth is ancient. We are new. So new. This was a project born of passion. We've worked on this video on and off since

JOiGEI9pQBs,2023-10-10T14:00:02.000000,Ancient Life as Old as the Universe,"Life has existed on one planet for about 4
billion years, as far as we know. But it might have started right after the Big Bang, when
the universe was much stranger and more fantastic than today. A universe that might have allowed
life to develop absolutely anywhere. The cosmos might be full of the seeds of life, sleeping
in a dead desert, waiting for a few drops of rain to explosively bloom and grow. Tiny
and not so tiny aliens might be everywhere. In this video we are going to put together
two highly speculative yet scientifically grounded possibilities – check out the scientific
papers in our sources. To properly explain it let's first look at the paradox of life
on Earth. The Life Paradox For its first few hundred million years, Earth was a magma hell constantly 
bombarded by asteroids. But basically the second things calmed down
and the first oceans formed, life just appeared and zillions of microbes settled every 
nook and cranny they found. This is kind of strange – life on Earth
seems to be almost as old as the planet itself. As if it was waiting around for an opportunity.
But life didn’t only appear extremely quickly: in that tiny time window, 
it also crossed a huge gap. To qualify as living things, even microbes
need to eat, poop, grow and multiply. To do that, they need a genome, 
the biological instruction manual that sets the inner workings of an organism. How dead things with no genome became living
things with genomes is one of the biggest riddles of science. Simplifying a lot, the
problem is that to have a functioning genome you need proteins, and to make those proteins
you need a functioning genome. Both proteins and genomes are super long molecules 
made of pretty complex blocks that are extremely difficult 
to assemble by chance. It is a chicken-egg paradox 
with several chickens and eggs. Once you have a finished cell, the whole system
works efficiently. But starting from simple dead stuff and reaching 
that level of sophistication  by pure chance should require an amazing amount of time for trial and error. So how did the
first living things manage to cross that gap in just a few hundred million years? Most theories about the origin of life try
to explain that gap by theorizing how some primitive soup of prebiotic molecules could have efficiently produced 
the first self replicating entities. But we still don’t know how exactly
this would have worked. Maybe we need to think backwards. The Clock of Evolution Think of genomes as a book telling the history
of life. As time passed and life evolved, more characters were introduced: Amoebae,
fish, amphibians, dinosaurs and mammals. Over billions of years, the story 
of lifegot more and more complex. A genome can be viewed as a long string 
of letters with biological instructions. And from microbes to us today, functional 
genomes seem to have been increasing in size at a fairly constant rate.  The functional genome of fish is more than twice
that of worms; our functional genome is about twice bigger than that of fish and so on.
It is a bit more complicated, but for now let’s run with this. When we put all these clues together,
it seems that genomes have been doubling in size on average every 350 million years or
so. As if evolution had been following an exponential inner clock. 
But it gets even stranger. The very first microbes that emerged on Earth,
even if they look simple, already seem to have had pretty long and complex genomes.
But how could life have achieved that level of complexity in such a short time? There may be an interesting way to solve this
riddle: We just take our exponential clock and extrapolate it back in time, to the simplest
conceivable life form – something equivalent to a being with a genome containing just a
few letters. But if we do that we end up 10 billion years in the past. More than twice
the age of Earth, which means: If life actually evolved like this, it did not start here,
but somewhere out there, in space. This would explain why life started to thrive
so quickly on our young planet. If it was already present in space like a seed, it just
needed water and warm temperatures to wake up and go on evolving. And it would also explain
the high degree of sophistication of the first life forms on Earth. They could have been
complex already because they might have been evolving for billions of years 
somewhere else in the universe. But could life really be that old? Maybe yes.
Actually, life could have started shortly after the universe itself was born. A Goldilocks Baby Universe At its most basic level life needs two things:
the right chemical elements to form complex molecules and a liquid medium like water,
in which those molecules can move and interact. The liquid medium needs to stay warm enough
to remain, well, liquid. So when we search for life in space, we focus
on Earth-like planets at just the right distance from their star – warm enough to sustain
liquid water. But there was actually a time when almost
all of the universe might have been habitable. Right after the Big Bang the universe was
extremely hot. But as the cosmos expanded, it cooled. And between about 10 and 17 million
years after the Big Bang, when the universe was a thousand times younger than today, it
was between 100 ºC and 0 ºC – the temperature at which water is liquid. So for this window
of time, more than 13.7 billion years ago, the whole universe, absolutely every 
inch of it, had the right temperature to support life. Of course, the right temperature
alone is not enough for life. We also need chemical elements like carbon and oxygen,
which are forged in the cores of stars. But were there stars in super early cosmic times?
Maybe yes – in regions of the universe where matter was especially dense. Such stars
would have been very massive and gone supernova in just 3 million years – seeding the baby
universe with the chemical elements needed to form dust, asteroids, planets
and the ingredients of life. Maybe the first ancestors of life were more
exotic and didn’t even need water, but thrived in substances like ammonia or ethane that
can stay liquid at temperatures far below 0 °C. They could have been sustained by the
lingering warmth of the Big Bang for tens of millions of years longer, well into a time
when we know for sure there were stars and all the chemical elements. The real magic of this idea is that while
the universe today is extremely deadly and hostile, back then the conditions for life
might have been basically everywhere. For a period that may have lasted several dozen
million years, primordial life might have been able to emerge on any rock,
even between the stars - sowing the universe with the 
seeds of what, billions of years later, would become bacteria, 
trilobites, dinosaurs, and finally us. At some point the universe cooled below the
right temperature for life to thrive, but some of those ancestral life forms may have
continued to exist in the internal warmth of the first planets, frozen in asteroids
or hibernating in cosmic dust – tiny seeds roaming the cosmos waiting for new hospitable
places to continue evolving. If they did, life now might be everywhere in the universe. Will We Ever Know? All this makes for a nice story. And while 
both the habitability of the baby universe  and our exponential clock of life 
are reasonable ideas – they are still speculative. One more possibility among many others, trying
to explain our existence today. But if life came to Earth from outer space,
then it should have seeded other places in the solar system too. Maybe there are fossils
in dry riverbeds on Mars. Maybe we’ll soon find life in the warm underground oceans of
Enceladus or Europa. Titan has seas, rivers and lakes of ethane and methane as warm as
the universe when it was 90 million years old. So finding exotic life on Titan would
support the idea that life could have originated in the weird baby universe. So far, when we look out into the cosmos we
don’t see anyone like us. But maybe that's because life needed ten billion years or
more to reach the level of complexity that allows for a technological species. Maybe
there are millions of worlds filled with microbes, oceans full of exotic fish, and continents
of bizarre animals. And maybe even others like us, that just recently gained consciousness
and are beginning to look at the sky, wondering if they are alone. Life could be flourishing right now in uncountable
forms and in all kinds of cosmic environments. And if many of us share a common cosmic origin,
we would all be part of a great cosmic family. The answer may lie in our cosmic backyard.  Let’s go and find out!"
LBudghsdByQ,2023-10-04T14:00:02.000000,Why Humans Are Vanishing,"Every two years one million Japanese 
disappear.  China’s population will halve by the end of the century, the median age in Italy has reached 48.  All around the world birth rates are crashing – Is humanity 
dying out? What is going on and how bad is it? For hundreds of thousands of years the human 
population barely grew at all, haunted by disease,   famine and war until the industrial revolution – 
exponential progress led to exponential growth,   pushing our numbers to 6 billion in the 
year 1999 and 8 billion just 24 years later.   And our numbers will continue to rise 
for at least another 60 years – but this growth obscures something: 
People kinda stopped having babies. For a stable population, every couple needs to 
have two children on average. If the number is higher it grows, if lower, it shrinks. 
If it's well below, it shrinks a lot, and quickly: Like in South Korea, one of the hottest 
exporters of pop culture. Its fertility rate lay at 0.8 children per woman 
in 2022, the lowest in the world. This means 100 South Koreans of childbearing 
age today will have 40 kids. Who then will have 16 kids, 
who then will have 6.   If nothing changes then within 100 years 
there will be 94% fewer young people  and South Korea will see a population implosion. 
That is if things stay the same – we have yet to see if there is a 
bottom to fertility rates. Although looking at the bigger picture and absolute 
numbers, this population will not shrink that much – it simply returns to the level it once was. 
In 1950 there were 20 million South Koreans,   in 2023 there are 52 million. And by 2100 there 
will be 24 million again. But the issue is not that there 
will be fewer South Koreans,  the issue is the composition of the population. In 1950 the median age was 18. In 2023 it is 45. 
In 2100 it will be 59. A country of seniors. And South Korea is far from alone. China may be seeing the steepest population 
reversal in history, unstoppable at this point. Rapid industrialization, urbanisation and 
rising incomes meant that the Chinese started to   prefer smaller families. That, plus the 
introduction of the One Child Policy,   which aimed to slow population growth, means that 
China has had a low fertility rate for decades. With a fertility rate of 1.16 births per woman,   within four generations 100 young 
Chinese will turn into 20.   China's fertility rates are now one of the 
lowest in East Asia, lower than even Japan's. In comparison Europe’s depopulation 
is much slower despite low fertility,   since unlike Asia most states have had a steady 
flow of immigrants. The impact is complex,   as a good chunk of immigrants come 
from other low fertility rate areas,   the number of immigrant women who do have a lot of 
children is not yet high enough to make a big dent   and fertility rates of immigrants tend to adjust 
to the native population within 2-3 generations. In Eastern Europe, the decline has sped up even 
more because many young people have emigrated to   stronger economies, like Germany – whose median 
age is one of the highest in the world at 46. Latin America fell below 
replacement in 2015. In the US,   immigration is the only thing keeping 
the population growing substantially. There are still places where fertility 
rates have not fallen below replacement yet:   In much of the Middle East, North and Sub 
Saharan Africa fertility is still high,   which creates the same concerns 
about overpopulation as when   Asia grew very quickly in the 1950s, 
but that turned out to be unfounded. But recently the UN has reduced its forecast 
for Africa’s population drastically. For Nigeria   estimates were lowered from 733 million 
to 546 million by 2100. Similar trends are   being noted across the continent. As Africa 
develops, fertility rates are shrinking much   faster than anticipated. It is becoming 
more likely that East Asia’s story will   repeat itself – by the end of the century most 
places in Africa may be below replacement too. So declining fertility rates 
and ageing populations have   become a general trend, all over the world. Why is all of this a big deal? Demographics & Poverty For a functioning society you need enough 
people in the prime of their lives. Young and middle aged people do most of 
the work. In any economic system,   working age people create a society’s wealth. In retirement you stop contributing as 
much to the economy. But the majority of   healthcare costs are generated by 
seniors. The way the world worked   in the past was that a lot of younger 
people took care of a few older people. Imagine a society where most people are 
older than 60. The financial burden for   the young will be immense, unsustainable 
even for the richest countries. Even in the best case this will mean 
people having to work way longer,   exploding health care costs and poverty, while 
states with shrinking income struggle to keep up   with rising costs. Technology might soften 
the blow, but can’t compensate entirely. We can see this happening already – 11 out of 
31 provinces in China are running deficits for   their pension funds. They got old before 
they got rich and now they can’t really   catch up anymore. China’s working age 
population is predicted to fall by 20%,   or 200 million people by 2050 – as much as 
today’s entire working age population of the US. Infrastructure collapse is an almost 
universal constant of population decline.  Because infrastructure works at scale and 
doesn’t get cheaper to operate if it is used   by fewer people. If a population declines, 
be it because of urbanisation or the loss   of industry and employment – once people and 
their income disappear, the resources necessary   to sustain infrastructure disappear too.
You can see it in many depopulated towns   and cities in East Germany that suffered 
sharp population decline after German   reunification. Or look at Japan. You can 
tour the countryside to see dying towns. Wait – if there are fewer people, won’t life get 
cheaper and better and there’ll be more resources   to go around? Well no – population decline 
doesn't lead to prosperity. It’s people’s   ideas and work that create our prosperity, 
not the mere availability of resources. Another danger for ageing societies is that 
elected governments could decide to mostly   represent the interests and fears of their 
elderly populations – potentially leading   to short term thinking and a preference 
for conserving wealth over innovation.   That's not a society that can handle 
issues like climate change, which need   massive investment and fresh ideas – something 
the world is already having a hard time with. Many people think that having fewer humans on earth is 
actually a good thing because our societies are   too unsustainable, we are using up too many 
resources and because of climate change. The problem is, that even if you want fewer
humans, this process is very likely too slow   to have a positive impact on the environment – the 
world population is going to grow for at least 60   more years before it may shrink again – by then we 
have to solve climate change. Likewise, any other   upsides a lower population might have will most 
likely not materialise themselves this century. So Just Like 
Import People? The easiest solution seems to be immigration, 
but the fertility of immigrants adjusts to local   levels within three generations. So you need 
a constant influx of new migrants – which is   not sustainable long term as birth rates are 
dropping everywhere. The only way would be   to keep poor countries poor, so that the young 
and motivated migrate to developed countries,   looking for opportunity and a better life. 
Kind of an immoral thing to wish for. By the end of the century Africa will have 
the highest number of young people in the   world and so African migrants might become 
the world's most sought after immigrants,   with elderly nations fighting hard for 
every person willing to make the move. Immigration also can create societal or cultural 
tensions, which is a universal phenomenon in all   cultures – especially when cultures with very 
different sets of values meet – often leading   to a backlash that slows immigration down 
again. It’s easy to be frustrated at this,   but ignoring this will only divide societies, 
empower demagogues and increase xenophobia. Economically, immigration is 
largely beneficial for societies,   even if this seems counterintuitive to many 
people. Especially countries like the US,   an immigrant nation built on the idea of personal 
freedom and opportunity through hard work,   will benefit the most. Countries like this 
will have a clear advantage this century,   especially if they can attract the 
world’s brightest and most ambitious. Conclusion & Our Opinion This topic is way too big, affects 
societies as diverse as literally   all of humanity. So please take this 
part with a gigantic grain of salt,   obviously we are looking at this from 
our central European perspective. One way to look at falling birthrates is 
as a side effect of the world being less   bad than it was. Especially women are
freer, more educated and wealthier than in the past.   But it turns out that if societies are better 
off, individuals often decide to have fewer kids.  Interestingly, there is a gap between how many 
kids people want and how many they are having: The mean number of kids women in Europe want is 
around 2.3, much more than they are actually having. While we gained a lot of freedoms in the last 
century, across continents and economic systems,   that came at a cost: The tight knit 
communities and family structures   that were part of our nature, where 
kids could be brought up by a village. Today young parents have to deal with 
different challenges and societal expectations. Women are kind of ground down between the wish 
and expectation to have a family and a career,   being pressured to do both but not 
compromise either. Men are sharing   parental duties more equally than they used to, 
but are often still expected to be the provider. And it is sadly true that usually, at least one 
parent's career is held back. In many developed   countries the gender pay gap is chiefly a 
pay gap between mothers and everyone else. But it is not just outside pressure: Our 
culture of individualism probably plays a   role too. We have only one life to explore, be 
free, travel, have fun, accomplish something and try to be happy. So people commit 
to partners later in life and often   decide against big families or any at all. And 
that’s fair, nobody owes their country babies. So far no country has successfully managed 
to increase birth rates significantly,   so as of now we don’t really know what works. But 
here are a few options to at least make the lives   of parents much easier: free and abundant access 
to childcare, financial benefits for parents,   more and cheaper housing. Parenthood has to stop 
being a career obstacle. And our culture needs   to become more positive towards families. 
And that is something we can all work on.   The next time you sit next to a crying baby 
– don’t be a jerk about it. Kids are hard. In the end, humanity will not die out because we're having 
fewer babies. The age and composition of our   societies changes quickly and we need to deal with 
that sooner rather than later. But in the end,   of all the incredibly hard challenges we faced 
before, why would this be the one we can’t solve?  Getting to the bottom of the population crash

wmP3MBjsx20,2023-08-22T14:00:08.000000,How A Nuclear War Will Start - Minute by Minute,"Mr. President! Nuclear missiles will 
strike our country in 14 minutes. I know it’s your first day in office so I’m going 
to walk you through it, but you’re the only one who can authorize our nuclear retaliation in   response and you’ve only got a 
few minutes to make a decision! As you know tensions have escalated 
rapidly in the past few days. Today’s joint allied aerial defense exercise 
began just minutes before we detected the launch. A simple misunderstanding maybe. We assume the sudden attack is meant to neutralize 
as many of our nuclear forces as possible. But that doesn’t matter now – missiles are in 
the air and we can’t shoot all of ‘em down. Why? Because Intercontinental ballistic 
missiles are basically rockets launched into space before re-entering the atmosphere over their 
target and releasing many different warheads. Higher and faster than anything 
you can send after them. We need to get you to the bunker! Here is what we know: Four minutes ago 
our new infrared monitoring satellites detected one hundred twelve bursts consistent with 
ICBM launches from the enemy’s inner territories.   For some reason only 20 of their 80 underground 
nuclear silos seem to have fired, so we suspect   most of them were transporter-erector launchers, 
you know: trucks with big missiles on them. It’s unclear why they didn’t 
use all their silos – they   might just not work after more than thirty years or they might be keeping them in reserve. The 
fog of war is keeping many things unclear! Aerospace Command thinks the ICBMs are 
targeting our nuclear command centers,   silos, and major airforce and navy bases, 
ending this war before we have a chance to act! The enemy’s strategic doctrine prioritizes 
military targets and our nuclear weapon   systems, but their secondary targets are our 
industry and infrastructure – oil refineries,   power stations and deep water ports. All 
located near or in major population centers. We won’t know the exact 
casualty count for a few weeks. Deaths from the blast and burns 
may be a few million today. It’s morning rush hour and there’s not much 
to be done for people stuck in traffic. People in major metro areas can’t really 
evacuate, but emergency broadcasts are   being sent out to shelter in place and away 
from windows. Radiation exposure for intact   population centers is highly dependent 
on the weather over the next week. We might be looking at dozens of millions 
of deaths by the end of the month. For the next few minutes we can   still respond, but –
You need to decide! We’ve got 1500 warheads across our 
silos, bombers, and submarines. The 400 in silos need to be launched now
before they get taken out. 46 nuclear capable bombers on high alert
can be ready to take off in 2 minutes – though we need to transmit the order now
to get them out of the blast radius if you want to consider using them. Of our 14 nuclear submarines, 
5 are presently at sea. While they’re submerged they’re 
undetectable, so that’s our   back-up for a nuclear retaliation
if we lose our silos and bombers. We could try to use them 
to bomb out their remaining  silo fields before they can launch them. The sooner you commit to it, 
the better the chance we have of preventing a further 
exchange after our retaliation. Updates! We have radar confirmation that the enemy ICBMs  have completed their burn 
and deployed their warheads. Our best guess is that each missile will 
deploy at least 6 re-entry vehicles,   about 600 in total, which is the part that 
carries a warhead back into the atmosphere   during its terminal descent onto the target 
– and with many more decoys on top of that, inflatable balloons meant 
to waste any anti-missiles.  We’re now tracking nearly 4000 potential targets. Our anti-ballistic missiles have been launched 
and will begin their intercept in another minute. We’ll do our best to protect the capital,
although there really is no defense. Wait… confirming a partial radar 
blackout, our systems seem to be glitchy. The enemy must have anticipated we’d launch our   interceptors and pre-detonated 
a few warheads at high altitude. That ionizes the atmosphere 
and creates radar interference. Our interceptors should still operate okay,   they’ve had a 55% success rate in 
tests but never with this many decoys or with radar interference this intense.
We might shoot down 50 objects,   but there’s no guarantee they’re warheads.
It looks like most bombs are going to get through. This is our last chance to counterattack. 
We’re out of time. Our silo launch   sequence takes 5 minutes. We have to 
transmit and confirm a launch order and the missile needs time to clear 
the blast radius of the incoming bomb. This is a lot to take in, 
but the war plan is made,  you just need to enter the 
launch authorization codes and push this button to transmit them! You can’t do anything else 
to save more of our people. If you don’t launch now then this war will be  over before it even begins –
you understand this is our one chance, right? The effect? Enemy civilian casualties are hard 
to estimate, but should be similar to ours – a few million right away, perhaps a few 
tens of million by the end of the month. The total fallout from their attacks 
and ours might trigger a nuclear winter,   potentially killing billions around the world – 
but that might happen even if we don’t retaliate. I’m sure you have questions but you have  to give orders without expecting 
answers right now. With an attack of this scale there’s no guarantee communications or assets will 
be intact in a few minutes. We’re out of time, we need a 
decision Sir. Can we launch? Nuclear wars aren’t regular wars. They 
only last minutes, and in times of crisis,   small conflicts can rapidly spiral out of 
control. Anything from small communication lags to sensor errors to just uncertainty and the 
fog of war mean that no leader will ever have a complete idea of what’s happening as a crisis 
unfolds. When tensions are high, accidents or   misunderstandings can steer leaders - even those 
with good intentions - to launch a nuclear attack.   Confused and with incomplete 
information, a single person – yes, it's really just ONE 
single person who decides – can literally make civilization-ending decisions killing hundreds of millions of people in 
the time it takes to watch a YouTube video. This story is fiction, but the world 
came very close to this several times. In 1995 Russian radar detected a submarine 
launched missile and their nuclear forces went   on full alert, except it was actually 
a scientific rocket to study auroras. In 1979, US computers reported a full scale 
Soviet attack with only minutes to respond  – except it was a training tape being 
incorrectly loaded into a computer. In 1983, the Soviet satellite alert system 
showed five ICBMs launched from the US. But it was a false alarm caused by
sunlight reflected on clouds. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Soviet submarine with no contact to
Moscow for several days concluded that   nuclear war had begun and decided 
to launch a nuclear torpedo. Luckily the authorization 
of  three officers was required. One of them, Vasily Arkhipov, opposed it.
But what if he hadn’t?  Any safeguard can fail, no matter 
how carefully designed it might be. And decisions are being made right now
to build new weapons and missile systems that commit the world to another 
century of nuclear stalemate, complicated further by China's emergence
as a new nuclear superpower. Simply accepting that the existence of nuclear   weapons is inevitable might 
mean their use is inevitable. But the world doesn’t have to be 
this way. Even incremental steps,   taking apart one bomb at a time, will 
eventually result in a world with none.   During the Cold War, the world had over
70,000 nuclear weapons – through arms reduction treaties,
that number is now about 12,500. Progress is not guaranteed, 
but it’s also not impossible. Governments and militaries are not separate 
from their nations, they’re part of them,   just like you. You have the power to 
make demands of your leaders and often   this begins with just being aware of
an issue. If you want to learn more,   we've compiled a number of resources for you

Kr57ax0OWMk,2023-08-08T13:59:49.000000,The (Second) Deadliest Virus,"Few of the monsters that evolution created have 
been so successful at hurting us as the variola   virus, responsible for smallpox. The carnage 
it caused was so terrible and merciless that   it compelled humankind, for the first time, 
to act truly globally. It was one of the   greatest wins of our species over the ancient 
powers of nature, all made possible by… cows.  Variola is a virus, a tiny machine that only 
seeks to reproduce itself. Evidence of It has   been found in Egyptian mummies and in writing 
from India and China as old as 3000 years.   1300 years ago smallpox killed up to a third of 
Japan’s population. By the sixteen hundreds, it   was one of the major causes of death worldwide. 
In late 18th century Europe, it killed 400,000   a year. Every third person who went blind did so 
because of this virus. Even in the 20th century,   a hot second ago in history, it still killed at 
least 300 million people. Smallpox is an abusive   monster that returns over and over and over 
again, killing, maiming, and disrupting societies. How could variola be so incredibly deadly for 
so long and how could we have forgotten its   horror so quickly? In 2023, there are only 
two laboratories left where the living virus   is officially stored for research: 
in Koltsovo, Russia and in Atlanta,   USA. Which is certainly a good idea 
because what could possibly go wrong? Let’s say that through an unfortunate series of   events the virus got out and you got 
infected. What would happen to you? How Smallpox Kills Variola is highly infectious and catches a ride 
in small droplets you breathe in. Immediately it   begins to infect the cells that line your throat 
and starts killing them to cause chaos. Why?   To trick your body into giving it 
a lift. Whenever cells in your body   die a violent death, your immune 
cells immediately stream to the   site of infection to help out. In 
this case that backfires horribly. As immune cells begin cleaning up dead 
cells, eating viruses and killing infected   cells , variola infects a crucial cell of 
your immune system: Your Dendritic cells,   intelligence cells that gather information 
and leave the battlefield to get help.   They enter your lymphatic system, a highway 
network that spans your entire body and   connects hundreds of immune bases. In these 
bases your heavy defenses are activated and   should be the last place an enemy would want 
to invade, but Variola wants to get here. For about 12 days, the virus quietly 
infects civilian and immune cells,   jumping from cell to cell infecting more and more 
of them. At some point a critical threshold is   reached and variola starts its attack for real. 
Millions of viruses use the lymphatic highway   to spill into your blood and organs, infecting 
your whole body. Suddenly variola is everywhere. But despite this global attack, your 
adaptive immune system is struggling to   wake up. Your immune cells look for and use 
critical transmitters called interferons to   mobilize the body against viruses. Interferons, 
as the name suggests, interfere – significantly   slowing down virus infections but also quickly 
activating millions of anti virus weapons.   But Variola is able to deactivate interferons, 
which stuns the anti virus side of your defense   system. Other systems would usually help 
- like the complement system, a sort of   mobile minefield that can destroy viruses but 
variola also manages to shut this down too. And so, with little resistance variola spreads 
everywhere and infects billions of your cells   all over your body. Among the infected are your 
capillaries, the smallest blood vessels in your   body, which die in great numbers. All this death 
activates an immune cell that you really don’t   need right now but that is attracted by death: 
The Neutrophil. Normally an efficient killer of   invaders great and small, it is not very effective 
against smallpox. And even worse, Neutrophils   fight by vomiting deadly chemicals, which 
kills even more of your cells. On top of that,   they order inflammation, fluids streaming from 
your blood vessels into your tissue. All over your   body, as first millions, then billions of your 
cells die, you get a rash that only gets worse   and worse. Pus and cellular junk fills it up as 
your body swells up with hundreds of lesions, all   over your skin and inside, even on your organs, 
all filled with billions of variola viruses. Now the critical phase begins. As you fight 
for survival, you burn up in a high fever,   thousands of battlegrounds drain your blood of 
fluid that streams into your tissue and organs.   Blood clotting appears all over your body while 
floods of toxins from dead cells build up and can   cause organs to fail. Your lungs fill up with 
fluid, making it harder and harder to breathe.   One of two things happens now: Either your immune 
system wrestles back control – heavy weapons have   been dispatched, killing infected cells, cleaning 
up the thousands of infections one by one,   killing variola wherever it can be found so 
you can slowly begin to recover. The immune   system will forever remember variola, making 
you immune forever. Or, you die, overwhelmed   by the infection and your immune system's 
panicked reaction to the body wide infection. About a third of people who contract 
smallpox don’t survive. And if you survive,   you are very likely branded by scars and 
may even lose your eyesight or hearing. For thousands of years this terrible disease 
ravaged the world, leaving death and destruction,   traumatized and maimed survivors. Until 
one day, humanity said: “enough”. 
   Why don’t we have smallpox anymore? Smallpox is one of the worst diseases 
humanity has ever known. A murderous,   family destroying, life ruining monster. 
There was nothing you could do for the   infected – but people noticed that 
if you survived, you were immune.   So out of desperation, they came up with a 
dangerous practice of variolation: Take scabs   from an infected person that had a mild case of 
smallpox, let them dry out and grind them to a   fine powder. Then blow the powder up the nostril 
of a patient or scratch their skin with it. If   things went well, they only got a mild version of 
smallpox and gained immunity against the disease. Variolation probably worked because it introduced 
the variola in a part of the body the virus wasn’t   prepared for, disabling most of its nasty 
tricks. And because the inoculation was   left to dry out, that damaged the virus 
so it could not cause the full disease. Unfortunately 2-3% of all patients still died 
because they got the smallpox or suffered   other diseases as a result of treatment. Still, 
smallpox was such a horrible and to some degree,   unavoidable disease that people took the 
risk, for themselves and their children.   Variolation spread around the globe, 
while Variola continued to kill millions. A victory over the virus only became a real 
possibility when scientists realized that   it was not necessary to variolate with the 
real smallpox disease, but much safer to use   material from cowpox, a variant that affected, 
surprise, cows. A truly revolutionary step – and   only a few years later, this led to one of 
humankind's most outstanding achievements:   Vaccinations. The innovation was simple – 
instead of using the real virus to train   the immune system, use a related virus, cowpox, 
that was only mild but also gave you immunity. Still, it would take another 200 years, countless 
individuals fighting the monster where they could,   delivering vaccines to the most remote places 
on earth. All the while the disease ravaged on,   killing over 300 million people 
in the 20th century alone. In 1966 the World Health Organization decided 
that humanity had to come together in a final,   major effort. A global ""smallpox news 
network,"" based on residents in hotspots, was   created – tackling local outbreaks of the virus. 
Cases were encircled, vaccines given, preventing   further spread. Smallpox only infects humans, 
so if we stopped the human transmission chain,   we would starve the virus. The last naturally 
occurring infection was in 1977, and in 1980,   just shy of 200 years since the first vaccine 
was used, Smallpox was declared eradicated. Variola, the scourge of humanity, was dead. 
No more children would be killed by it,   no more mothers or brothers or uncles or 
cousins. It is hard to convey to people   around today what an incredible win this was. 
One of the cruelest, most dangerous monsters   that has hunted us for literally millenia 
was slain, by us, apes with pointy needles.
   Today we live in a time of enlightenment. 
None of us alive today are haunted by the   specter of smallpox. This light is not 
natural; it was set in the sky by the   sheer will of humankind wanting to be 
safe from the monsters haunting us.   But because we live without them, we forget 
that they ever existed and that they are real.   That the diseases might reawaken, or 
new ones might be brewing in jungles,   wet markets or laboratories, 
ready to strike us once more.   We forget what an incredible gift vaccines 
are and how hard we had to battle to get them We are still protected by the light but it is 
cooling each and every day, and we owe it to those   who will come after us to make sure it doesn't go 
out. We killed one monster. We can do it again. This video was supported by Open Philanthropy. Do you want to continue learning about the

9FppammO1zk,2023-07-02T13:00:42.000000,The Most Dangerous Weapon Is Not Nuclear,"A breathtaking scientific revolution is taking
place – biotechnology has been progressing at stunning speed, giving us the tools to
eventually gain control over biology. On the one hand solving the deadliest diseases
while also creating viruses more dangerous than nuclear bombs, able to devastate humanity. What is going on? Biotechnology is increasingly everywhere. The cotton in your clothes, the vegetables
you eat, your dog. Humans manipulate living things. We use bacteria to produce insulin, connect
prosthetics directly with our brains and make industrial enzymes to produce paper. Gene therapy creates cures to previously untreatable
diseases while we are working on food crops resistant to climate change.  Our mastery over biology has been speeding
up so much that within weeks of the first Covid 19 case, the unknown coronavirus was
broken down in laboratories and analysed. Scientists generated a copy of its genetic
material to create a vaccine that was ready for testing months after the pandemic began. Something unthinkable a decade ago. Where is all this sudden progress coming from? Well, it's complicated. But in a nutshell: really expensive things
got cheap and knowledge of how to do impressive things spread freely. The Human Genome Project starting in 1990
was the first major attempt to read human DNA in its entirety. 13 years and $3 billion
later, it was complete. By then the cost of decoding a human genome
had fallen to about $100 million. Today it is 100,000 times cheaper, costing
only about $1000. How is that possible? Converting DNA into computer data and then
studying it used to be a super tedious process, taking expert humans around 3 years of manual
work. Today it takes about two weeks and is almost
completely automated.  Biotechnology has gone from something restricted
to the best and well-funded laboratories staffed by the world's top experts, to something affordable
enough for hundreds of thousands of people to casually work on.  What has sped up the process even more is
that information in the field is shared widely and freely. Cutting-edge discoveries now take just about
a year to be copied in laboratories around the world, a few years for anyone with a biology
background to work out, and a bit over a decade for high school students to experiment with
them in schools. Imagine that your local computer repair shop
could build a pristine Iphone 11 with just the parts lying around, and that teenagers
are asked to build a new Iphone 5 for homework. Not a crappy homemade version, the real thing. This is what is going on right now in biotechnology
– a true revolution.  We are adding knowledge at unprecedented rates,
while things get ever faster and cheaper to do. This speed means we can expect even more wonderful
things for humanity. Lifesaving treatments, miracle crops and solutions
to problems we can’t even imagine right now.  But unfortunately progress cuts both ways. What can be used for good, can also be used
for bad, by accident or on purpose.  For all the good biotech will do for us, in
the near future it also could easily kill many millions of people, in the worst case
hundreds of millions. Worse than any nuclear bomb. The world just witnessed how fast the novel
coronavirus spread. We still do not know for sure if it came from
nature or was the result of an accidental leak from a lab working with corona viruses,
that’s still subject to scientific debate. In the end at least 7 million people died. And this was still a relatively mild virus
that didn’t cause serious disease in most of those infected. But that might change in the future. Wherever the last pandemic came from, the
next one might very well be our own fault – in a sense, many things going on in biotechnology
could lead to this. Most of all how easy it is to work with dangerous
viruses. Thousands of scientists can simply order the
genetic data of infectious virus samples online to experiment with them. Assembling these into an artificial virus
in 2023 costs about as much as a new car, including all the lab equipment.  At the same time, other scientists are trying
to find viruses that hide in nature, like in wild bats or monkeys. There are probably plenty of potentially deadly
pandemics out there. Virus hunters take samples back to the lab
to learn whether the newly discovered viruses are likely to spread in humans and catalogue
the danger. When a biologist discovers a new virus, they
usually publish its genetic data to the public. Journals are eager to share descriptions of
potentially dangerous viruses.  Other labs go further and make viruses more
dangerous. They combine and mutate different viruses
to understand which mutations make them more likely to spread between humans or make them
deadlier than their original forms. And again, these results are shared freely. All while synthetic DNA and equipment to rebuild
these viruses are sold online to anyone without any or very little tracking. As the tools of biotechnology get ever cheaper
and easy to use and the data on dangerous viruses keeps multiplying, it is only a matter
of time before a well-meaning scientist shares blueprints for the equivalent nuclear bomb
of viruses, a superbug that will cause millions of deaths  – and someone uses it. Maybe because they have bad intentions, maybe
because they are irresponsible or sloppy. We are creating an environment in which it
is increasingly easy for anyone to create a weaponized virus in their backyard.  This is scary. The world would be plunged into an unending
crisis as new pandemics pop up year after year or all at once – killing large parts
of the world’s population, doing unimaginable damage to civilisation as a whole, and possibly
undoing centuries of progress.  It’s not the first time we’ve faced a
challenge like this and we are not helpless – think of nuclear technology. Something extremely powerful and dangerous
with huge upsides and downsides. Nuclear energy was born from weapon programs,
so its creators were always aware of the potential for their knowledge to be abused. From the very beginning it was clear that
knowledge in this field and access to the technology needed to be handled with utmost
care.  So a lot of effort has gone into making sure
no radioactive material disappears from sight or that countries don’t try to hide weapons
development behind energy programs. The result hasn’t been perfect, but considering
the 411 nuclear power stations running today, we’ve been very successful. Likewise, no researcher would think to share
data on how to turn common laboratory equipment into bomb-making machines on the internet.  There is no reason we could not handle the
really dangerous aspects of biotechnology in a similar way! Experts have come up with three sort of bullet
points: First we need to delay the next deadly pandemic
by getting a grip on how we treat dangerous viruses. Their genetic data should be treated as an
infohazard: information that poses a danger to society if it is shared without care. In other words, not just anyone should be
able to order dangerous DNA online. And if you do, you should be tracked, so it
becomes much harder for the wrong people to access the really spicy stuff.  The next step is detecting the danger by becoming
aware which viruses are present among us and are spreading explosively between humans. This could be as easy as having labs in population
centres maintain virus detectors that monitor what is going on in the micro world. If we suddenly see certain microorganisms
show up a lot in a short time, we can react quickly and start counter measures. Which is the final step: Destroy. We basically need to build a machine that
is ready to destroy any pandemic threat before it has a chance to take over. We can do this with new tools that are being
developed right now, like nanofilters that pull dangers out of the air we breathe or
specialized UV lamps that just kill any virus before it has a chance to jump from person
to person. And of course, we need to get better at getting
new vaccines faster than ever before in history. If we do these three things, the chances are really
good that we can avoid a catastrophic pandemic in the future.  Biotechnology,  like any exciting and powerful
technology, is neither inherently good or bad. It has the potential to be both in breathtaking
ways. We have the chance to a future where we get
to truly control biology  - our biology,  the biology of the plants and animals around us
– and the biology of the microworld. So let’s use it to create a future where
we triumph over pandemics and diseases for good. This video was supported by Open Philanthropy.  If you want to help and want to have a high

that we put out into the world seriously and you set high standards for our research and
fact-checking process.  This hurt. A lot. We wanted to be better than that. So we deleted it and contacted experts and
spent hundreds of hours on research and illustration and developed a new visualization of the relationships
between species that did not exist before. A Map of Evolution you can use to figure out

since we had spent so much time on it, we turned it into a poster. And from that a new vision was born: We wanted to become the best infographic and scienceposter shop in the world. Today we’ve designed almost 100 posters

uoJwt9l-XhQ,2023-06-18T13:00:41.000000,The Reason Why Cancer is so Hard to Beat,"An undead city under siege, soldiers and police 
ruthlessly shooting down waves of zombies that   flood from infected streets, trying to escape 
and infect more cities. This is what happens when   your body fights cancer, more exciting than any 
movie. How does this battle for survival unfold? 1. The Elimination Phase It all begins with a single corrupted cell. It 
is no longer able to repair its genetic code,   it can’t kill itself anymore and it is beginning 
to multiply rapidly. At this point things are   not great, not terrible – this cell is not yet 
dangerous but if nothing happens, it soon will be. Over a few weeks the corrupted cell keeps making 
copies of itself. One cell turns into dozens,   hundreds, thousands. Because the 
original was broken, its copies are   breaking and mutating even more. They 
turn into different genetic lineages,   clans that are working together and competing. 
Some mutate in a way that makes them weaker,   others’ mutations don’t change anything, 
while a few become fitter and better at   survival. Together they now form a tiny, tiny 
tumor. Not cancer yet, but getting there. The growing tumor needs a lot of resources. 
If the cells don’t get food and oxygen,   they will die and the problem just solves itself. 
Unfortunately a few corrupted cells unlock a new   mutation that saves them: The ability to 
order the growth of new blood vessels. And   so your body provides the supply they need to 
survive. But as the tumor continues to grow,   it starts causing damage – Neighbouring 
healthy cells begin to starve and die,   which attracts attention. In a sense 
this tiny tumor is like a rogue town. Imagine a group of rebels in Brooklyn decided that 
they were no longer part of New York but started a   new settlement called Tumor Town, which happens to 
occupy the same space. The new city wants to grow,   so it orders tons of steel beams, cement 
and drywall. New buildings follow no logic,   are badly planned, ugly and dangerously crooked. 
They are built right in the middle of streets,   on top of playgrounds and on existing 
infrastructure. The old neighborhood   is torn down or overbuilt to make 
room for new stuff. Many of the   former residents are trapped in the 
middle of it and begin to starve. This goes on for a while until the 
smell of death finally attracts   attention. Building inspectors and police show up. In your body, attracted by the stench of dead 
cells your immune system is activated. First   responder immune cells invade the tumor: 
Macrophages and Natural Killer Cells,   police forces that go right to work, killing 
and eating tumor cells. They release chemical   signals that let the whole immune system 
know that there is cancer to be eradicated. Dendritic Cells, the intelligence 
officers of your immune system,   collect samples of dead tumor cells and begin 
activating your heavy weapons: Helper and Killer   T Cells. We explained these specialized super 
weapons in another video, but all you really   need to know is that they have a library listing 
every bad thing that could come into your body. While each cancer is unique, there are 
genetic corruptions that they can’t hide.   And your T Cells know what to look for. They 
are the deadliest cancer killers you have. By the time they arrive, the tumor has 
grown to hundreds of thousands of cells,   but this is about to change. T Cells 
block the growth of new blood vessels,   which starves thousands of tumor 
cells and puts an end to their growth. Imagine the building inspectors, switching 
off electricity and water and putting up   roadblocks to cancertown so no more 
food and materials can be delivered. With no way to hide from the carnage unfolding, 
the tumor collapses as hundreds of thousands of   tumor cells are massacred. Their carcasses are 
cleaned up and consumed by Macrophages that then   order healthy tissue to regenerate. Your body 
has crushed the illegal Tumor Town without mercy. You will never know about this fight or how 
many times this has happened inside your body. Except… in this case something 
did not go as planned. 2. The Equilibrium Phase Unfortunately, natural selection spoils your 
victory. By doing its best to destroy the tumor,   your immune system accidentally selects 
the fittest tumor cells. Remember,   the tumor consists of different lineages 
that keep growing and keep mutating. Most   of these are eradicated. But just a few 
are more resilient. One cell survives – it   comes from the fittest tumor lineage and was 
just a bit better at surviving the massacre   than anyone else. It decides to do it 
all over again. But better this time. This tumor cell is much stronger than any of 
the thousands that were killed. Maybe it is   better at hiding, or fighting back. Maybe 
it grows faster or is better at stealing   resources. Maybe it can survive with much 
less oxygen. And so it all begins again. It's like the surviving rebels that started 
Tumor Town have learned their lessons. Now   they know the law better and how to break it, 
what permits help them, how to avoid the police. And so the surviving tumor cell makes thousands 
of copies that mutate and form new lineages,   until once again a tumor has grown, 
made up from more resilient cells.   The immune system does not care though, and this 
time it even has experience - instead of starting   with police, swat teams go right in to tear Tumor 
Town down, killing its inhabitants without mercy. But once again they don’t get everyone. One 
of them survives: a fitter tumor Cell from   an already fitter lineage. This time it gets 
a cheap suit and studies the building code,   pretending to be a lawyer to start Tumor Town all 
over again. This struggle now repeats a few times,   each time the rebels learn a bit more about 
how to avoid the law. If at any point,   the immune system gets all of the tumor cells, 
the story ends. But in this case, it doesn’t. Finally, a tumor cell changes in a way 
that makes it properly dangerous, cancer.   The type that kills people. How? Immune cells have an off switch that deactivates 
them before they can attack – which in principle   is a good idea. The immune system is extremely 
dangerous and in many cases it needs to be   shut down, like around your central nervous 
system. But this off switch can be exploited. The mutated tumor cell finds a way to switch the 
immune system off by targeting inhibitor receptors   on anti cancer cells. Inhibitor receptors 
stop immune cells from, well, killing.  This cell is the now powerful founder of a 
new lineage of cancer cells and mass produces   thousands of new copies that once again change and 
mutate further. Building yet another Tumor Town. 3. The Escape Phase The new cancer cells have become immune to 
the immune system and everything is different   this time. Tumor Town has been rebuilt, 
even uglier and stranger than before,   but now the cancer city council 
has forged all sorts of permits.   As building inspectors come to shut 
down construction, they get confused.   Stunned they wander off, unable to order 
the destruction of the sprawling buildings. Police try to enter the illegal city 
to arrest the builders and execute   inhabitants – but this time Tumor Town 
has erected its own roadblocks that keep   the law from entering. Confused 
officers stand around helplessly. As Tumor Town slowly envelops the former 
Brooklyn and more and more civilians die,   T Cell swat teams arrive to end this travesty. 
But things got worse – new lineages of Tumor Town   officials have started to forge court documents 
that order police to shoot at the Swat teams. What the cancer cells are doing at this 
point is actively shutting down immune   defenses by sending corrupt signals. The now 
malignant tumor is no longer a pushover and   has begun creating the Cancer Microenvironment. 
A sort of borderland that is hard to cross. All   avenues of attack have been shut down and 
uncontrollable growth is the consequence.
   This is a dangerous tumor. Cells 
that are strong and able to fight,   push your immune system back and expand further. 
If more mutations happen, then some of the cancer   cells will begin to explore the world and 
expand into other tissues, to build new towns. And this is exactly what makes cancer 
so harmful: it is taking up space and   stealing so many nutrients that your true 
self has no room to function anymore.   If this goes on for too 
long, organs will shut down. But this tactic is a dead end. The more 
successful cancer gets, the more damage it   does to its world. When the body dies, the cancer 
dies too. It truly is a game without winners. Except, humanity is planning to win this game. At this moment hundreds of thousands of scientists 
are working on new and better ways of killing   cancer, to destroy and burn down Tumor Towns 
for good. In recent years immunotherapy has   made enormous progress – it is a relatively 
new therapy in which your own immune cells are   modified to kill cancer better than any medicine 
can do. It's like giving your building inspectors   machine guns and flamethrowers. But this is a 
story another time – For   now cancer is a battleground – but if human 
ingenuity is to be trusted, then one day,   maybe in the not too distant future, we 
will eradicate it once and for all. This video was made possible in part

V4Z8EdiJxgk,2023-06-11T12:59:39.000000,The Black Hole That Kills Galaxies - Quasars,"The universe looks like a vast empty ocean 
sprinkled with the rare islands of galaxies..   But this is an illusion. Just a small 
fraction of all atoms are found in galaxies,   while the rest is thought to be drifting 
in between, in the intergalactic medium.   Like the roots of some massive tree, 
gas spreads out from each galaxy,   gravity funneling fresh mass 
into this dense, cosmic forest. 
   Here in the intergalactic medium, are the raw 
materials of creation: hydrogen and helium,   woven into sheets and filaments that flow into 
galaxies where they eventually create stars. But if we look closely, we see who is actually in 
charge: Quasars, the single most powerful objects   in existence. As small as a grain of sand compared 
to the amazon river, they reside in the centers   of some galaxies, shining with the power of a 
trillion stars, blasting out huge jets of matter,   completely reshaping the cosmos around them. 
They are so powerful that they can kill a galaxy. What are they, and how do they mold the 
structure of the universe at their whim? Everywhere You Look, Weird Things in the Sky In the 1950s astronomers noticed mysterious 
loud radio-waves coming from spots all over   the sky. They were named “quasi-stellar 
radio sources”, or “quasars” because they   were dots like stars, but were seen in 
radio waves rather than visible light. Everything about them was strange. Some flickered, 
others emitted high energy X-rays in addition to   radio waves, but all seemed to be tiny. They 
also moved extremely fast, as much as over 30%   the speed of light. The only explanation was 
that they must have been so distant that their   apparent speed was actually the expansion 
of the universe moving them away from us. But these enormous distances meant that quasars 
couldn’t just be stars, but the active cores of   galaxies billions of lightyears away! And it 
gets crazier. To appear so bright and loud,   given these vast distances, they are thousands 
of times brighter than the entire Milky Way.   Monsters, exploding and screaming into the void 
with a violence not thought possible before. As we mapped the sky, we discovered over a million 
quasars. And they all seemed to be very far away.   Looking into space, far away means very 
long ago, because their light takes so   long to reach us. Quasars were common 
in the early universe, having peaked   in number 10 billion years ago when galaxies, 
and the universe itself was still very young. Let’s go back in time, just 3 billion years after 
the big bang and see what was going on back then. The Incredible Power of Quasars How could an early baby galaxy be 
so incredibly bright and violent? All that light and radiation couldn’t be 
stars, as there weren’t nearly enough of   them. And since galaxies tend 
to grow with time by merging,   the starlight from small galaxies shouldn’t 
be far brighter than any galaxy today. There’s only one way to generate the vast 
amounts of energy a quasar shines with:   feeding supermassive black holes. We 
still don’t know how exactly they formed,   but it seems that every galaxy 
has one in their center. But how can the brightest things 
in the universe be black holes,   which trap anything and everything 
that crosses their event horizon?   Well the light of a quasar is not coming 
from inside these black holes. Rather,   it comes from the space around them, a massive 
orbiting disk of gas called an ‘accretion disk.’ Quasars use the same fuel as stars to shine: 
Matter. It is just that black holes are the   most efficient engines for converting 
matter into energy in the universe.   The energy released by matter falling 
into a black hole can be 60 times   greater than that released by nuclear 
fusion in the core of a star. Because   the energy released by a black hole comes 
from gravity, not from nuclear reactions. Matter falling into a black hole speeds up to 
almost the speed of light before it crosses   the event horizon, buzzing with an incredible 
amount of kinetic energy. Of course, once inside   the black hole, it takes that energy with it. You 
only get to witness this energy if you drop your   matter in the right way. Fall straight down and 
the outside universe gets nothing. But when you   have a lot of matter, it spirals in incredibly 
fast towards the event horizon forming a disk.   Collisions between particles and friction heat 
it up to hundreds of thousands of degrees.   In a space not much bigger than our solar system,   the core of a galaxy can release many times 
more energy than all its stars combined. This is what a quasar is, a super 
massive black hole having a feast. And these black holes eat a lot. Typical 
quasars consume one to a hundred Earth masses   of gas per minute! Ten billion years ago, the 
universe was about a third of its current size,   so the intergalactic medium was much less 
spread out, meaning the filaments of gas   around quasars could feed them a banquet, making 
them vomit insane amounts of light and radiation. The brightest quasars power jets, tangling the 
magnetic field of the matter around them into   a narrow cone. Like a particle accelerator 
they launch enormous beams of matter out,   plowing through the circumgalactic medium, 
forming plumes of matter that grow to hundreds   of thousands of lightyears in size. It’s 
almost unfathomable in scale. A tiny spot   in a galaxy carving out patches of the 
universe 100,000s of light years long. But quasars can’t eat for long, 
maybe a few million years,   because their feast ultimately kills their galaxy. How Quasars Kill Galaxies Okay, maybe “killing” is a bit of an exaggeration. 
A galaxy is still there after its quasar turns   off. But it will never be the same again. Quasars, 
being among the hottest and brightest things in   the universe, break their galaxies by heating 
them up too much and stopping star formation. Hot gas cannot form stars. This sounds odd, 
because Stars are gas that collapsed in   on itself and then got really hot. But 
in a cloud of gas that is already hot,   atoms are moving quickly. When they collide, 
they hit hard, exerting pressure that resists   gravity’s squeeze – so hot gas can’t 
form stars. Instead, the best gas for   forming stars is already cold, and won’t put up 
a fight when it’s time to collapse into a star. On top of that, quasars push gas out of 
their galaxies. Not only does this starve   the quasar, but its galaxy loses 
the raw materials for new stars. As sad as this sounds, it might be a 
good thing for life. The alternative   can be far more dangerous: too many stars. 
New stars forming is usually followed by   massive stars exploding in supernovae, 
so planets would be burned sterile. But of course it's more complicated. Like the 
intricacies of our own planet’s biosphere,   every piece of the galaxy is dependent on and 
influencing every other part of the galactic   environment. While hot things, like quasars and 
supernovae, tend to push gas out of the galaxy,   shockwaves and quasar jets can also compress 
gas, making new stars at least for a short   time. And gas that leaves will mix with gas coming 
back in and recycle it back into the galaxy. But   in general we can say that without 
things becoming a bit more chill,   we would not exist today. Which 
brings us to our final question: Did the Milky Way Have a Quasar in the Past? It’s unclear if every galaxy went through a 
quasar phase, but understanding distant quasars   may provide clues to the history of the Milky 
Way. Galaxies don’t do a good job of preserving   their history. Like sand on a beach the endless 
churning mixes away the clues to their past. It’s possible the Milky Way was once a quasar,   which may have allowed our supermassive 
black hole Sagittarius A star to have   grown to 4 million times the mass of the sun. 
But sadly we don’t know its ancient history. And as dormant as it is now, Sagittarius A star 
could turn into a quasar in the future. In a few   billion years the Milky Way will merge with 
Andromeda. We’ve seen over a hundred ‘double   quasars’ in galaxies smashing together, where 
fresh gas is provided for the central black holes.   But it won’t last for long. When galaxies 
merge, so do their super massive black holes,   sinking into the center of their new galaxy, 
kicking up dust and stars in every direction. We don’t know whether this will happen, but 
it would truly be an incredible sight. Maybe   some beings in the far future are going to 
witness it and be in awe of what they see. But you don’t have to wait that long. There 
are already plenty of fascinating things to   explore right here on this planet, right now – 
if you have the knowledge to understand them. To help you with that, we’ve created a series of 
lessons to take your scientific knowledge to the   next level. Made in collaboration with our friends 
at Brilliant.org, these lessons give you a deeper   understanding of the topics from our most popular 
videos, from rabies and mammalian metabolism,   to climate science. There's also a lesson 
on black holes, where you can delve into the   fundamental principles behind their formation 
and behavior. A deeper understanding will also   help you appreciate their role in powering 
the quasars we talked about in this video. Brilliant is an interactive learning tool 
that makes math, science, and computer   science accessible with a hands-on approach. 
Because we know that to really learn something,   you’ve got to do it. Think of each lesson as a 
one-on-one tutoring version of a Kurzgesagt video. Brilliant has thousands of other 
lessons to explore, as well—from   math-based topics like algebra and probability to 
courses around programming and data science.Their   latest course, “How Technology Works,” takes you 
inside the technology you use everyday. You’ll   walk in the footsteps of a hacker to discover 
why some passwords take decades to crack,   explore how satellites in space know that your 
ride share driver is just down the street,   learn why your favorite Kurzgesagt 
video might buffer on YouTube, and more. To get hands-on with Kurzgesagt lessons and

zFhYJRqz_xk,2023-05-09T14:00:42.000000,Your Body Killed Cancer 5 Minutes Ago,"Somewhere in your body, your immune system 
just quietly killed one of your own cells,   stopping it from becoming cancer, and 
saving your life. It does that all the time.   The vast majority of cancer cells you 
develop will be killed without you ever   noticing. Which is an incredibly hard 
job because of what cancer cells are:   parts of yourself that start to behave 
as individuals even if it hurts you. 
   What is cancer and how does 
your body kill it all the time? INTRO Cancer is when corrupted 
cells multiply uncontrollably. It can emerge from basically 
every type of cell in your body,   so there is not just a single 
type of cancer but hundreds.   Some grow slowly, others are aggressive, some 
can be treated effectively, others are deadly. In a sense, a cell that becomes cancer turns 
into something ancient and something new. Over   billions of years, evolution has molded cells 
to survive and thrive in a hostile environment,   fighting for space and resources. Until a new 
and exciting way of life emerged: Cooperation,   a division of labour that allowed cells to 
specialize and become more successful together.   But cooperation requires sacrifices. For 
a multicellular being to stay healthy,   the wellbeing of the collective has to matter 
more than the survival of the individual cell. Cancer cells stop being part of the 
collective and become individuals again.   Your body can handle a few rogue cells but 
some cancer cells divide, again, and again,   becoming a sort of new organism within 
you. Taking resources you need to survive,   competing for the space you inhabit, destroying 
the organs they were part of in the process. Despite the harm they cause, cancer cells 
are not evil. They don’t want to hurt you.   They don’t want anything. Cells are protein 
robots that just follow their programming,   which unfortunately has been corrupted. The Soul of the Cell In a nutshell, your cells have a nucleus filled 
with DNA. It consists of genes – instructions   for how to build proteins and when to make 
each one.These building instructions are   copied and transferred to ribosomes, where 
they are used to make proteins. What kind   of proteins your cells make determine what 
they can do. The important thing here is   that a corrupt gene means you get a corrupt 
protein, which will get important later. Your DNA gets a tiny bit corrupted – it 
mutates – tens of thousands of times each day.   Most of the time without any 
special cause, just by being alive.   Almost all of these mutations are fixed 
very quickly or are not problematic. Still, over time as your cells 
make copies of themselves,   damage is accumulating. Imagine having 
to make copies from copies from copies,   for decades. Maybe one day a hair got 
on the scanner or a corner got frayed.   Each new mistake becomes part of the new 
copies and all the copies that follow. You can increase DNA damage by doing 
things like smoking, drinking alcohol,   by being obese, breathing in asbestos, by 
not using sunscreen or contracting a virus   like HPV. But the simplest way to damage DNA 
and get cancer is to be alive long enough.   For many cancer cases, there is 
no cause other than bad luck. The Damage that leads to Cancer We are simplifying, but roughly,   there are three categories of genes that 
need to be corrupted so cancer can arise. The first key mutation is in the appropriately 
named tumor suppressor genes, or TSGs.   These genes are a bunch of things. For 
one, they produce control mechanisms that   continuously scan your DNA for mistakes 
and copying errors and fix them right   away. And then they keep normal cells from 
multiplying recklessly. If TSGs become damaged,   your cells basically forget how to repair 
themselves and can reproduce unchecked. The second crucial mutation can happen in your 
oncogenes. When oncogenes are turned on the   cell is told to multiply rapidly.They were super 
active when you were inside your mother’s womb.   To turn a single original cell into 
trillions in months, it needs to divide   and grow rapidly. These rapid growth genes 
are turned off when there is enough of you.   When your oncogenes get corrupted, 
they basically turn on again. The third crucial mutation is 
in your cells’ suicide switch.   Most cells are constantly recycled and refreshed. 
When cells amass too much damage, they usually   notice and special genes trigger a controlled 
suicide called apoptosis. If the genes that   control this process get damaged, cells are free 
to live on despite being dangerously corrupted. So if a cell becomes unable to fix 
the mistakes in its genetic code,   loses the ability to destroy itself 
when it notices the damage, and begins   to grow rapidly without restraint, 
it turns into a young cancer cell. These cells have to be killed as quickly as 
possible: while they are bad at this stage,   they are still pretty weak and easy to 
kill. But if they continue to mutate and   increase in number, they can learn to avoid 
your defenses and become a real threat.  At any moment of your life, your immune 
system is hunting these cells. But how do   you identify and kill corrupted cells that 
seem indistinguishable from healthy ones? How to Find Cancer Well, here we come back to the proteins your 
cells produce and the story they tell. So if   for example, your oncogenes switch back 
on, they make oncogene proteins. Your   immune system knows that they should 
not be present if you are an adult. So to know which cells are 
corrupt and which are healthy,   your immune system needs to know what proteins 
they are making inside. To solve this evolution   came up with MHC class I molecules, a sort of 
display window that makes cells transparent. Cells constantly take little samples of 
the proteins they make and put them into   thousands of these MHC molecules, 
to showcase what they are doing.   The selection is constantly refreshed, 
always giving an up to date picture. There is a whole library of proteins that 
are highly dangerous and should not be made   by healthy cells, and your immune system has them 
all on file. It has billions of specialized cells,   called T Cells, made to recognize specific 
proteins. If a T Cell sees a forbidden protein   in an MHC display window, it knows that the 
cell is corrupted and kills it immediately. But there is a flaw in this system. What if a cancer cell mutates and finds 
a way to circumvent this process? All it   needs to do is to stop making MHC Class 
I molecules, and boom, it’s invisible.   Without display windows, the immune system 
is blind and can’t identify cancer anymore. Fortunately evolution found an ingenious solution:   The Natural Killer Cell. A 
judge, jury and executioner. The Killer At this very second, hundreds of millions of 
Natural Killer Cells are patrolling your body   looking for cells that have already turned 
into cancer or are corrupted by a virus. Natural Killer Cells go from cell to cell to 
check for one thing: Does a cell have MHC class   I molecules? Does it have a display window and is 
it doing its duty of showing off what is going on   inside itself? This is so amazing because it 
covers all of your bases: While T Cells look   for the presence of the unexpected, something 
that should not be here, Natural Killer Cells   look for the absence of the expected, the 
absence of something that should be here. The logic is: if a cell does 
not have display windows,   it wants to hide something. And a cell 
that hides something must be killed. What makes the Natural Killer Cell even more 
metal, is that it is always in murder mode. It   patrols your body, checking cell after 
cell with the intention of killing it.   Your healthy cells have to convince it that they   should not die today. And a way to do 
that is to have MHC class I molecules. So in summary, almost all young cancer cells you 
will ever develop in your life will be killed   by your immune system. Ok, but if your body is 
this prepared, why do we still get cancer? Well,   sometimes cancer cells mutate more 
and get much better at fighting back.   Cancer is a story of an arms race. An arms race 
that we will win eventually, maybe with the help   of Natural Killer cells! Right now a number of 
therapies are beginning to show amazing promise,   from cancer fighting vaccines, to engineered T 
Cells and even Natural Killer cells – we will   look at these therapies in future videos. 
So the war is not won yet, but we are on   to cancer and eventually it will be eliminated 
once and for all – maybe sooner than we think."
GDSf2h9_39I,2023-04-11T14:00:45.000000,Why Aliens Might Already Be On Their Way To Us,the universe is magnificent and vast hundreds of billions of galaxies trillions of stars and even more planets if even the tiniest fraction are habitable then the universe should be teaming with life and yet we see nothing only vast to emptiness where is everyone else the answer to this riddle could be as exciting as it is creepy we are early born before almost all other life but very soon this may change not only might aliens appear they could quickly surround us an irreversible competition for the universe might be about to [Music] begin while this video is based on scientific papers we're presenting interesting ideas based on little data and lots of extrapolation so take them with a grain of Sal okay we need to look at three essential questions to understand the galactic competition one how fast can bacteria build spaceships to become a starfaring civilization Life as we know it needs to master a number of very hard steps it starts with dead stuff turning into the building blocks of life then it needs to organize into self contained cells those cells have to learn to work together to form multicellular organisms this keeps going until complex creatures with big brains learn to use tools and language civilization has to be formed from cultures that value progress and technological development and then they need to actually venture out beyond their home planet on Earth life appeared basically as soon as the oceans formed but then it took 2 billion years to make the step from single cells to multicellular organisms and 2 billion more for us to appear culture civilization and space travel developed super quickly though do things always take that long or was this actually exceptionally fast also passing One Step does not mean the next one is guaranteed multicellularity evolved over 25 times independently on Earth but there's only one species that builds spaceships we don't know how many steps life needs to pass and how long they take to give rise to a technological civilization but there are probably many and it's likely that on trillions of planets life has been trying for billions of years since we don't see any other technological civilizations out there it might well be that we are a rare exception we might be among the first or even the first technological civilization in the Milky Way but this is just one piece of the puzzle on top of that we may have just hit the perfect time window why does Humanity exist now now the universe is already 13.8 billion years old but it's unlikely that many other technological civilizations had a chance to appear before us because in the earlier universe life would have had a pretty hard time to emerge let alone Thrive because it was such a hostile environment early Stars constantly blew up galaxies crashed into each other and super massive black holes vomited massive amounts of radiation a enough to sterilize galaxies over and over again our son was born right at the end of this Cosmic death show the universe has never been more welcoming to life than it is now so Humanity has arrived at a very convenient spot in time maybe the earliest reasonably possible for life to thrive what about the future the sun burns brighter than 90% of the stars in our galaxy and will keep getting brighter in about a billion years it will boil all of Earth's oceans and then become a giant that swallows it whole so in the galactic context the sun is very shortlived most stars are red dwarves that can sustain habitable planets for tens of trillions of years life on these planets has an incredibly longtime window to appear and pass the hard steps even knowing nothing about how rare or common life is this makes it way more likely for technological civilizations to appear sometime in the the future than in the past because if civilizations appear at random in the Milky Way within a Time window of a trillion years then very few if any would appear before today then a couple more arrive in this period of a billion years that we're in before all starfaring civilizations that could ever exist emerge all together this weird tsunami like distribution is the result of both the hard steps model and something else a sort of deadline for any space fairing civilization any civilization coming after will find it hard to have room to survive so all potential life has to cram in before it Humanity exists now because otherwise we might have missed this deadline what or who creates this deadline why aren't aliens already on Earth humans are curious expansionist and hungry for we've spread over the world and made it our own our technology has been improving over time first slowly then breathtakingly fast if these things don't change drastically and our descendants want to prosper they will expand into space we could construct a Dyson SW for Endless energy and transform planets into new homes we could cross Interstellar distances allowing us to reach for planets around distant Stars if we have the most motivation we can become a Galactic Civilization a civilization that does this sort of stuff can be called Loud because its activity creates noise signs that can be detected from far away imagine someone in a forest cutting down trees starting fires and laying down roads the more intense their work the easier they are to notice an expanding technological civilization would probably be hard to miss our telescopes would pick up all that energy and we would clearly identify artificial interference with stars and planets another consequence of this business is that it's very disruptive to the environment clearing a forest means the end of its Wildlife human activity has left no chance for a squirrel civilization to appear not because we hated squirrels it's simply that the thought that they might want to do that at some point never crossed our minds and we needed work similarly if loud civilizations were running around the G in the past terraforming planets or harvesting the energy of stars they may have prevented our existence had aliens started colonizing Earth while we were still sludge in the oceans that sludge would never have turned into humans this is how loud aliens create a deadline for new civilizations appearing the Galaxy may have trillions of years to create life but there may only be a short window for it to spread and Thrive even if a loud civilization respects planets with natural occurring life and expands around them like humans do with Wildlife reserves any civilization on such a planet would not be able to expand ever trapped Forever on a tiny Island but here we are so loud aliens will probably never he what about aliens that don't expand they would be quiet aliens they're probably limited to one star system and don't have a noticeable impact on their Cosmic surroundings humanity is like this right now we wouldn't be able to detect ourselves from the other side of the Milky Way if they stay quiet forever maybe because of their culture or abilities then they are not really a concern for us we only have one sample to draw from humanity and right now we are on the path to becoming loud if we're not special and succeed anyway then any other civilization with the motivation and resources to would eventually expand Beyond its planet of origin oh okay what are the consequences of all these assumptions and ideas grave consequences race to the Stars if we are really early then eventually others will catch up with us civilizations will emerge all over the place and these new aliens will look at space see no signs of life and come to the same conclusion they exist because loud civilizations have not yet taken over everything but it only takes one loud civilization to crowd them out of the entire Galaxy they like us will face an important decision do they stay quiet take it easy and tend to their planet for as long as possible or do they start expanding to take a chunk of the Galaxy before someone else arrives meeting others does not necessarily mean War or conflict but it means that new borders will arise limits that may persist forever in the worst case a civilization could be completely enveloped by the empires of other eternally doomed to be a galactic Backwater without control over their fate so if we want to seat at the galactic adults table we best get to work if we really are early we have an incredible opportunity to mold thousands or even millions of planets according to our vision and dreams and one day when we meet others we can greet them and meet them as equals wouldn't that be nice if you want to explore the vast Universe from the comfort of your own home we've got a lot of amazing Space and Science inspired products for you all of our products are designed and produced with love and care by us here at kot kazak they're an integral part of the science story we try to

1x-i9z617z4,2023-03-28T14:00:05.000000,How We Make Money on YouTube with 20M Subs,"In 2023 Kurzgesagt has existed for 10 years, 
insanely long in internet years. We are among the   largest sciency channels on Youtube and still a 
bit of a black box to people. So let us talk about   ourselves a bit in three parts: Our backstory, how 
we finance our work and the values of Kurzgesagt! Let’s jump to a more innocent time. From humble beginnings to Today Kurzgesagt’s foundation was laid when Philipp, our 
founder, dropped out of high school as a teenager.   Learning seemed daft and useless and he was not 
interested in anything. Until a very special   teacher at a school for dropouts grabbed him 
by the neck. The way she taught was different.   She talked about connections and the big picture. 
She told a story. For the first time ever,   Philipp wanted to learn more without being 
forced. It was a key life experience. Kurzgesagt tries to recreate this 
experience for you. Nothing is   boring if you tell a good story 
and we try to tell these stories,   to spark excitement and make you 
want to go on and learn more. Because of the one teacher that could do 
this, Philipp got a high school degree,   studied history and design and eventually 
started Kurzgesagt as a passion project,   inspired by Crash Course World history. In 2012 Youtube was less commercial and more 
idealistic. You couldn’t make a living with   videos as involved as ours and that was fine. 
The goal was creative freedom and so for the   first few years, it actually cost money to 
make Kurzgesagt. We had no outside funding,   just intrinsic motivation and a few friends from 
university. We worked for clients during the day   and on Kurzgesagt at night, 80-100 hours a week. 
It was a real struggle but also very rewarding. But then Patreon launched, sponsorships 
started, our views increased, Youtube   changed. In 2015 the channel began to 
break even and then to earn a profit.   But we were pretty burned out at this 
point, so we decided to bring in more   friends and hire the first team members 
full time, creating a legal entity. More people meant that we could stop overworking, 
do more and improve. But we also needed to earn   more; the livelihood of real humans depended 
upon it. None of us had any experience in   running a company. We didn’t plan to become 
big or to grow – it sorta just happened. A decade later Kurzgesagt is 
not a small project anymore.  We are an animation studio, with offices 
in Munich and Berlin. We need computers,   monitors, tablets, desks, coffee, contracts, 
pay licences, taxes, rent and insurance. In 2023 our team consists of over 60 full 
employees and a lot of freelancers around   the world. Salaries alone cost millions 
of dollars a year, just to stay around. This creates an interesting problem: 
with such high production costs,  how can we publish our work for free? How we finance Kurzgesagt We have added up our earnings from 2015 through 
2022. Our sources of funding change depending on   opportunities and the state of the world. Early 
on, agency work was our main source of income,   ad revenue varies, in some years we got 
more sponsorships than in others. The shop   didn’t exist for a long time, then it became 
pretty big after we launched our calendar. 62% of our revenue comes 
indirectly or directly from you:   You watch our videos with ads, support 
us on Patreon or buy from our shop. The single biggest source of income by far, is 
our shop that alone accounted for 40% over the   last 8 years. The shop started small but once we 
published our calendar for the first time in 2016,   we realised it could really help us do more 
things and we started producing more and   more science products, from our posters to our 
gratitude journal or universe scented candles.   YouTube ads accounted for 13% and Patreon 9%. 
So without your support we would cease to exist. Our shop and Patreon are our most important 
sources of revenue, and because we see ourselves   as science communicators – we don’t just do 
merch, but sciency products that we spend   hundreds of hours researching, discussing with 
experts, polishing up and working on directly   with the manufacturers. They are part of the 
science story we try to tell. It also just feels   good to get directly funded by you guys and give 
you something back for it, on top of our videos.   YouTube ads are a crucial part of our funding 
as well, but they are not within our control. Then there is paid agency work, which we 
stopped doing in 2022 – it accounted for   9% of our revenue over the last 8 years. A 
lot in the beginning, not much by the end. Then there are commercial sponsors 
advertising products -they accounted   for 12% of our revenue. We also 
got about 7% from German Public   Broadcasting for the German Channel, 
but ended this partnership in 2022. Finally there are institutional sponsors 
representing about 10%. Some people take   issue with this – especially Bill Gates has come 
under public scrutiny, and we’ve been criticised   for even working with organisations funded by 
him. So let us look at this 10% in more detail: About 3% of our revenue over the 
last eight years came from the Gates   organisations for a wide variety 
of topics, often suggested by us. 5% comes from Open Philanthropy and is only 
used for specific projects. With these funds,   we have started Arabic, Hindi, Korean, Japanese, 
Portuguese, and French channels, bringing more   free science content to more people. Then there is 
a two-year funding for original Tik Tok content,   which gives us freedom to explore and learn 
how to do short form science communication. The final 2% came from other organisations 
like the red cross or the UN for example. We choose institutional sponsors 
carefully but if organisations   want to fund videos that help us spread 
quality information about relevant topics,   this is an easy yes for us, if we have 
the capacity for it. On top of that,   the institutional sponsors we are 
working with align with our values. We have contracts with every grant giver or 
sponsor that bars them from editorial influence,   other than suggesting topic areas like 
“global health” or “climate change”.   We agree on video topics together, but 
sponsors can neither influence details, nor   our conclusions. The final decision always remains 
with us. And usually, we develop the topics of the   videos autonomously and tell the sponsor what 
we are doing afterwards. If you are interested   in how we research our videos in detail, our 
head of research wrote an article about it. Running an educational youtube channel is a 
balancing act that we take very seriously. We   are doing our best to maintain this balance, 
adjusting whenever necessary. As a team and   company we want to grow to give more people 
access to a science based outlook on the world. This brings us to our final topic 
– why are we doing Kurzgesagt? Our Values and Our Vision Our core mission is to spark curiosity. We 
want to make science and humanism accessible   for as many people as possible. The effort 
we put into creating our videos is a way of   achieving that – our videos are beautiful 
because that helps to spark curiosity,   to understand complex topics, and because 
it just feels good to create and watch. Our research is as intensive as it is 
so our videos are a good simplification   of very complicated topics. We want 
to make people excited about science   so they rediscover subjects they hated 
in school and see how amazing they are. On top of curiosity, we want to inspire long term 
thinking and a positive, constructive outlook.   Being optimistic about the future of humanity 
is not mainstream and we think this is horrible.   Pessimism often sounds smart and 
gets more views while optimism can   sound naive but this is a bias that 
is not helpful for us as a species.   So despite the gloominess of many topics, 
we want to approach them with informed and   well researched optimism – not brushing 
humanity's very real challenges aside,   but also not falling into the trap of pessimism. 
We want to inspire you to dream a little about   the glorious future that we could actually 
build – but only if we believe it is possible. In the long run we don’t only want to do this 
on Youtube. The idea is for Kurzgesagt to be a   positive influence across more media. On our 
Tik Tok channel, in the long form content we   are exploring, in apps, in the VR game that will 
be released later this year and the games we plan   to make in the future. Our shop is a central part 
of this vision: we start our stories with a video   and end them with a pos
ter. There are so many things we want to do. And 
thanks to you watching this right now, we have   the freedom to work to the best of our knowledge 
and ability. In the end, we hope you like what   we offer and that we will be doing something 
worthwhile for as long as we exist. And hopefully,   we’ll have a lasting impact by making science and 
learning more fun for as many people as possible. If you personally want to help us do this, you can 
watch and share our videos, check out our shop,   become a patreon or give us an ad blocker 
exception. We exist because of you and   you have no idea how much we appreciate that 
you are here. And hopefully we are less of a   black box now. In any case. Doing Kurzgesagt 
for a decade has been a pretty crazy ride.   So from the whole team – Thank you so 
much for being with us all these years."
M-K7mxdN62M,2023-02-28T14:59:23.000000,What Actually Happens When You Are Sick?,"There is this idea floating around that what
doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger. That surviving a disease leaves you better
off. And it seems to make sense because we have
all experienced this. When you go through hardship, often you come
out more resilient, more ready to face a difficult situation in the future. But it turns out that sometimes, what doesn’t
kill you makes you weaker. So, what happens when you get sick? The Machinery of War Think of yourself as a large country, with
a sizable army to defend it. You are surrounded by enemies that want to
take your land, your energy, your resources. This is a matter of life and death, so your
body evolved to be sensitive to damage and to the presence of enemies. Because this means that an invasion might
happen at any moment and that it has to act fast. Let us start an invasion and see what happens. The moment your cells notice that something
is off, they release an onslaught of signal proteins called cytokines. They are like air raid sirens that activate
all sorts of immune cells, that then themselves release many more cytokines, amplifying the
alarm. Soon you are flooded with signals that trigger
precautions and counter-measures. Mobilization is under way. Your brain activates sickness behavior and
reorganizes your body's priorities to defense. The first thing you notice is that your energy
level drops and you get sleepy. You feel apathetic, often anxious or down
and you lose your appetite. Your sensitivity to pain is heightened and
you seek out rest. All of this serves to save your energy and
reroute it into your immune response. You become a country under attack switching
into a war economy, because properly activating your immune system is intensely disruptive
and draining. Just like war is expensive for a country as
industry switches to building tanks, your immune system demands huge amounts of energy,
amino acids and micro elements to build its weapons. Take fever: it speeds up your metabolism and
makes your cells work harder and faster, while creating heat that is pretty stressful for
many invaders – but it uses up a lot of calories to maintain. Then your immune system begins to clone millions
of specialized immune cells to respond specifically to the enemy infecting you. B Cells produce millions of antibodies every
second, each requiring hundreds of amino acids to construct. Billions or even trillions of proteins need
to be made to refresh the complement system, a minefield inside your blood. Cytokines, the mobilisation and information
signals, also need constant refreshing. Usually you acquire your resources by eating. But when you are sick, your body slows down
your digestion because it needs a lot of energy you can’t spare. So it reaches for the easiest source of amino
acids and starts breaking down your muscles. All that muscle that you worked so hard for
is sacrificed to keep you alive. If you are young and healthy and fit, you
will make up for that quickly once you are better. But if you are old or very young, weak or
suffer from chronic illness, this may be way too draining. Your body is literally consuming itself to
keep the defense going. If your whole system is already strained,
when you get sick, just keeping your immune responses going can overwhelm your capacities. Your Immune System is a Jerk. Our enemies too. Your immune system is as dangerous to you
as it is to enemies. There is a very fragile balance between the
damage caused by an infection and the collateral damage caused by immune cells. One of your first responders are Neutrophils
– imagine crazy aggressive chimps with machine guns. If a Neutrophil encounters enemies it showers
them with chemicals that cut them open but can also damage civilian cells, especially
if the patient is already compromised, for example by smoking. On top of that the microorganisms that invade
you often release chemicals and toxins that can cause significant damage and cell death. So a serious infection often causes many tiny
wounds, literally holes in your organs. As you can imagine it is not great to have
holes and wounds in your organs, and your body rushes to close them. Your Neutrophils and Macrophages help by releasing
chemicals that signal the body to start repairs, and most of the damage is quickly filled up
with regrowing cells. But others are filled with collagen, a sort
of fix-all organic cement that gives your gooey tissue structural integrity. You have seen the result on your skin as scars. A scar is different from the original tissue. It has no functioning cells in it, it is like
a sloppily applied cement patch. It can’t do what the original tissue was
doing. A scar on your heart makes it beat a tiny
bit weaker. A scar on the lungs no longer captures oxygen. A scar on your liver makes it a worse filter. And so, as you go through life and survive
serious disease after serious disease, the functionality of your organs may decrease. This damage is usually small enough not to
affect your quality of life – but can be permanent. Ok, this sounds depressing, but there is actually
something you can do to avoid a lot of this damage and train your immune system! The best way to train your Immune System Your immune system is unique. Everyone has a slightly different immune system
that’s stronger against some enemies and weaker against others. Which makes evolutionary sense, as this protects
our species from being wiped out by a single infection. Collectively, the immune system of the human
species is a spectrum: most people respond well enough to an infection, a few are super-responders
and a few don't respond well and die. Some people survived the black death, are
more resistant to HIV or Corona virus or even resistant against Ebola. Others are killed easily by the flu or highly
vulnerable to certain bacterial infections. Where you are on this spectrum is impossible
to predict. And you also respond differently to every
possible infection. This is why seemingly very healthy young people
died from Covid while for some elderly people it was more like a mild flu. The idea that you can weather all sorts of
diseases if you never get a cold is wrong. You never know what your immune system is
good at until it is tested. Getting sick is a gamble in life’s casino
with your health on the line. Always. But there is something you can do: hacking
one of the best features of your immune system. When you survive a disease, usually you have
better defenses against it afterwards – you gain memory cells that are very good at killing
the specific enemy you fought that day. So you either don’t get the disease again
or the next infection is much milder. And you can use an incredible achievement
of human ingenuity that taps into this mechanism to prevent damage from disease and train your
immune system: Vaccines. Vaccines basically pretend to be a disease
and train your defenses to be ready if it ever shows up for real. The goal is to create the same memory cells
that you would get after surviving an infection. But if you can feel some side effects, why
should you still do it? Nature Vs Vaccine Dojo You have two options to train your immune
system: Vaccine Dojo and nature dojo. In vaccine dojo you train with paper weapons
and learn to defend yourself. Sure, you might get a black eye or a bruise. Sometimes after a vaccine, you get sick for
a few days, but that’s generally it. No scars, no permanent damage. We discussed vaccine side effects in detail
in another video if you want to learn more. On the other hand, getting a disease to become
immune means going to a nature dojo. In nature dojo, you train with real weapons,
sharp knives and swords. Things might still work out, but with way
more cuts and wounds. But from time to time someone will die, be
it a kid from measles or an adult from influenza. Nature dojo is just way more risky. On top of that, the immunity you get from
a vaccine is often better than the natural resistance, because they are engineered to
engage your immune system in a more productive way. Of course vaccines are not magic and sometimes
they do not protect us as well as we’d like them to. Maybe because an enemy mutates too quickly,
like the Omicron coronavirus, or because your specific immune system does not respond well
to the vaccine and builds less of a defense. Still, being vaccinated is one of the best
tools to train your natural defenses. In the end, if we look at the stunning progress
humanity has made in the last century, eventually we may overcome disease for good. But until then we can do our best to take
care of ourselves and others - your body and your older self will be grateful to you. Diseases are not the only problem humanity
can address if we work together. We believe the same is true for climate change,
one of the main challenges of our generation. We are very passionate about this topic and
we have covered it extensively in previous videos. Humanity needs to tackle this problem on different
levels of society, from governments and economies down to the individual. And there’s one way you can take action
now – by working with our friends from Wren, who help you offset your carbon emissions. By visiting wren.co and answering a few questions
you can find out what your personal carbon footprint is. Your first step should be reducing your footprint
– but there are limits to that. Wren lets you offset the rest of your carbon
footprint with a monthly subscription that supports projects that plant trees, protect
rainforests, and remove carbon dioxide from the sky. We think it's one of many puzzle pieces that
can make a real difference in the climate crisis. Once you sign up to make a monthly contribution
you’ll get pictures and updates from the project you support, so you can directly see
the impact you are making. We appreciate Wren’s focus on transparency
and impact, so you can always retrace how your money is spent. One project we find especially interesting
is Refrigerant Destruction — Old refrigerators use harmful gases as a coolant. These gases, once released into the atmosphere,
cause global warming thousands of times faster than CO2. Wren’s project permanently destroys containers
filled with these gases—proving, with high certainty, that they’ll never leak and contribute
to global warming. Sign up through wren.co/kurzgesagt to start
helping the planet. As climate change is close to our hearts we
will personally pay for the first month of subscription for the first 200 people to sign

TYPFenJQciw,2023-02-14T14:59:37.000000,The Most Complex Language in the World,"you are cells your muscles organs skin and hair they are in your blood and in your bones cells are biological robots they don't want anything they don't feel anything they are never sad or happy they just are right here right now they're as conscious as a stone or a chair or a neutron star cells just follow their programming that's been evolving and changing for billions of years molded by natural selection they are impossible machines and yet here they are driven entirely by the fundamental forces of the universe the smallest unit of life right at the border where physics becomes biology sometimes to get a truer understanding of how amazing something is you need to hold your breath and dive in really deep so what are cells and how do they [Music] work look around the room you're sitting in right now let's fill it top to bottom with trillions of grains of sand billions of grains of rice hundreds of thousands of grapes a few thousand apples and a dozen watermelons this is what the inside of your cells looks like in terms of numbers they're mostly filled up with water molecules the grains of sand water gives the cell's insides the consistency of soft jelly and enables other things to move around easily or almost all the other things the rice and fruit are proteins several billion in total more than 10,000 different kinds depending on the function of the cell your cells are basically protein robots as is all life really in fact all solid nonfat parts of your body are mostly made out of protein even your bones proteins are dead things that make life happen how does this work the language of Life cells need to do many very hard things to stay alive get food in and waste out grow and build structures Escape danger or react to stimuli make copies of themselves and so on all of this is done by speaking the language of life and the words of this language are proteins this is how this language Works in a nutshell it all begins with amino acids tiny organic molecules they're the alphabet of the language of life there are 21 different ones like different letters amino acid a amino acid b c and so on if you put around 50 amino acids together they form a protein which in the language of life is a word and if you put many of these protein words together you get a sentence called a biological pathway let's oversimplify a bit and say for example your cell needs to break down sugar with the language of life it may take the amino acids for the letters b r e a and K to form the protein word break then combine this word with other protein words to form a biological pathway sentence that means break down sugar in reality this language of life is so complex that it defines imagination you need to know about 8,000 words to speak a human language really well but in the language of life there are an estimated 20,000 and while the average English word has five letters human proteins have an average of 3 175 amino acids the longest protein has more than 30,000 and cells need to execute thousands of steps at any moment if they ever stop speaking the language of Life they die okay but how do Mindless cells speak a language this complex let's dive a little deeper there are 21 amino acids that can be combined to form proteins and proteins are made up of dozens to hundreds to thousands of amino acids for the average protein length of a human cell of 375 amino acids you get a stunning 6.8 * 10 the power of 495 possible proteins your cells can make a quadrillion Google Google Google Google times more than there are atoms in the universe most of these possible proteins are useless just like with human language most random letter combinations are just gibberish so you need to know which words which proteins make up a language to speak it properly and this is the job of your DNA a long sequence of instructions if you untangle a cell's DNA it would be about 2 m long all of your body's DNA combined into one long string would reach to the Sun and back over 20 times around 1% of your DNA is made up of genes which are basically protein dictionaries that contain all the words of the language of Life your cells speak but genes are also the building manuals for all the protein your cells need to function the rest of your DNA is probably not useless but basically like a set of rules it's like the book of grammar of the language of Life which proteins need to be built at which time how many of them do you need which protein words go together and why okay letters words sentences dictionary and grammar but of course this is all just a metaphor for something mind-numbingly complex let's dive a little deeper to catch a glimpse of reality how dead proteins make life now that we have some basic principles we have a chance to understand how dead things make life together and for that we need a fundamental force of the universe electromagnetism the elementary particles that make up atoms which make up amino acids have different charges that attract or repel each other the 21 different amino acids all have slightly different charges some are are more negative others more positive when your cells build proteins they put different amino acids together in Chains basically long strings now because of the different charges of the amino acids used these strings begin to fold in on themselves this folding process is so complex that we still haven't completely understood how exactly it works but in a nutshell 1D strings become 3D structures proteins are basically 3D puzzle pieces with a very specific shape in the world of proteins shape is everything because its 3D shape determines which areas of a protein are charged in which way and this determines how it can interact with other proteins all of these differently charged puzzle pieces can snap together or repel each other when they snap together their charge changes which can make them change their shape which then makes them a new protein a new tool that can do new things this is what makes proteins so incredibly powerful you can do basically everything with them they can snap together like Lego pieces to build complex structures they can dismantle things they can form complex micro machines that use energy to do work and maybe most stunningly they can convey information let's say there's a toxic chemical entering your cell there may be a protein shaped to snap to that toxin if the protein finds that toxin it changes its shape with that new shape it can now snap into a different protein that changes its shape again this new protein activates a micro machine that directly binds to your DNA to order the production of a special protein which acts as an antidote to the toxin this Cascade of interaction is the pathway we spoke about earlier a sentence in the language of life so without a single active thought proteins have fixed a problem and saved the cell's life in reality these Pathways can have dozens to hundreds of steps how life operates is so incredibly or inducing somehow mind-numbingly complex interactions between dumb and dead proteins create a less dumb and less dead cell somewhere around here life happens but we still don't know what life is how dumb things are smart together we need another analogy so let's talk about ants ants share a fundamental property with cells they are really dumb as single ant will just stumble around uselessly but if you put a lot of ants together they exchange information and do amazing things constructing complex structures organizing themselves caring for Broods or attacking enemies although dumb individually together they become something greater this phenomenon occurs all over nature and is called emergence it's the observation that entities have properties and abilities that their parts do not have this is how everything in Your Body Works your cells are bags of proteins Guided by chemistry but together these proteins form a living being that can do a lot of really sophisticated things cells are Mindless robots that are even dumber than ants but many of them acting together form specialized tissue and organ systems from muscles that make your heartbeat to brain cells that make you think if you look outside at the incredible Dimension and scale of space a place where for ever is a real thing it's almost impossible not to feel a bit small not special but if you look inside into what you really are you just discover almost Indescribable complexity the beautiful language of

aeWyp2vXxqA,2022-12-15T15:00:12.000000,Black Hole Star – The Star That Shouldn't Exist,"black hole Stars may have been the largest stars that ever existed they burned brighter than galaxies and were larger than any Star today or that could ever exist in the future but besides their scale what makes them special and weird is that deep in sight they were occupied by a cosmic parasite an endlessly hungry black hole how is that even possible [Music] black hole Stars take the weirdness of black holes and go beyond to break everything we know about how stars form and grow they were only possible during a short window of time in the early universe but if they existed they would solve one of the largest mysteries of cosmology black hole stars were excessive anywh you look at them the most massive stars today may have about 300 solar masses a black full Star had up to 10 million solar masses of nearly pure hydrogen let's take a moment to look at what this means visually the sun weson LL pegasi the largest star and finally the black hole star its scale is beyond words over 800,000 times wider than our sun 380 times larger than the largest star we know today and Far Below its surface is a black hole growing rapidly as it devours billions upon billions of tons of matter per second normally Stars Are Born from gigantic clouds collections of thousands or millions of solar masses of mostly hydrogen in these clouds matter starts to accumulate around the densest spots inside as these spots get denser their gravitational pool intensifies and they grow faster eventually they generate so much heat and pressure that they ignite Fusion reactions and a new Star is Born but this puts a limit on their size nuclear fusion releases enough radiation energy that the surrounding gas cloud is blown away the new baby star can't gather more Mass from now on the star is living on the edge between two forces gravity pulling in trying to squash the star and radiation created by Fusion pushing outwards trying to blow the star apart after millions or billions of years is the core runs out of fuel and the balance brakes destroying the star but black hole stars were very very different the beasts of the early Universe a few hundred million years after the big bang when the universe was much smaller all the matter in existence was much more concentrated the universe was much denser and hotter Dark Matter was a dominant player forming giant structures called Dark Matter halos these dark matter Halos were so massive that they pulled in and concentrated unimaginably gigantic amounts of hydrogen gas becoming the birthplaces of the first stars and galaxies epic clouds of hydrogen formed some as massive as 100 Million Suns more than the mass of small galaxies in this unique environment that will never exist again the enormous gravitational pull of the Dark Matter Halos Drew gas into its Center and created extremely massive stars as we said before when A Star is Born it blows away the gas cloud that created it but these Titanic gas cloud in the early Universe was so large and massive that even after their birth more and more gas piled on the newborn star making it grow to unbelievable proportions the young star is forced to grow and grow and grow getting more and more massive until in some cases it reaches up to 10 million times the mass of our sun crushed by gravity its core gets hotter and hotter desperately pushing outwards trying to blow itself apart but to no avail there's too much mass and too much pressure the balance is impossible to uphold like a supernova run fast forward the core gets crushed into a black hole normally that would be the end today stars go supernova a black hole forms and things calm down but in this case the star survives its own death a tremendous explosion rocks the star from the inside but it's not enough the star is so large and massive that not even a supernova can destroy it but now it has a black hole for a heart it's tiny a few tens of kilometers in the center of a thing the size of the solar system the monster grows Stars Are Born from ever faster spinning and collapsing gas and so they also spin when a black hole is born from the core of a star it keeps its angular momentum this means that matter that gets drawn in doesn't just fall in a straight line but instead begins orbiting the black hole in smaller and smaller circles going faster and faster the result is an accretion disc where gas orbits at nearly the speed of light only a small amount of gas actually falls in at any given moment basically black holes put a lot of food on the table and only nibble at it but the matter trapped in the accretion disc doesn't have a good time friction and collisions between particles heated up to temperatures of millions of deg actively feeding black holes have accretion discs that are incredibly hot and Powerful this heat from the disc further restricts how much a black hole can devour just like the core of stars the super hot material creates radiation that blows away most of the food within its reach so even if a black hole had access to as much food as it desired it can only grow slowly a black hole embedded inside ins a black hole star is different the enormous pressure surrounding it pushes down matter directly into the black hole overcoming all restrictions on how fast it can consume this process is so violent and releases so much energy that the accretion disc becomes hotter and releases more radiation pressure than any star core ever could enough to push back against the weight of 10 million Suns an impossibly dangerous balance has been created millions of soda masses pushing in the angry radiation of a force-fed black hole pushing out for the next few million years the black hole star is consumed from within the black hole grows to thousands of solar masses and the bigger it gets the faster it eats which heats up the star even more and causes it to expand in its Final Phase the black hole star has become over 30 times wider than our solar system truly the largest star to ever exist in the the universe the intense magnetic fields at its core spew out Jets of plasma from the black hole's poles which Pierce through the star and shoot out into space turning it into a cosmic Beacon it must have been one of the most a inducing SES to ever exist in the universe but this also marks the end it becomes too stretched and the accretion disc within too powerful the parasite destroys its host blowing it apart a black hole hole with the mass of 100,000 Suns rips its way out to hunt for new prey while leaving behind nothing but a star carcass the super massive question if black hole Stars existed they could explain one of the greatest Mysteries of the universe the super massive black holes we see at the center of galaxies are just too big they shouldn't be possible black holes born from regular supernovas can be a few tens of solar masses at most and because of the process we explained before they grow slowly after that if black holes merge they can form slightly larger black holes of over a 100 solar masses it should take billions and billions of years to make black holes with hundreds of thousands or even millions of solar masses and yet we know that some super massive black holes already had 800 million solar masses only 690 million years after the big bang black hole stars are a sort of black hole cheek coat if they formed very early in our universe and the black holes that emerged from them were thousands of solar masses then they could be the seeds for super massive black holes these seeds could take root in the center of the earliest galaxies merging with others and drawing in enough matter to grow quickly and reliably very soon we may be able to verify their past existence the James web Space Telescope is turning its sens is to explore the farthest reaches of the universe looking back in time back to the early universe that we couldn't see before so with luck we might be able to witness glimpses of these tragic Titans in the brief moment between their formation and destruction until then let's do the visual Journey again just for fun stars are big black hole Stars bigger [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]"
HpcTJW4ur54,2022-12-11T15:00:09.000000,How to Terraform Mars - WITH LASERS,"Mars is a disappointing hellhole lacking 
practically everything we need to stay   alive. It looks like we’ll only ever have small 
crews spend a miserable time hidden underground.   Except, we could terraform it into a green 
new world. But to solve the planet’s problems,   we first need to make it worse and turn it 
into oceans of lava with gigantic lasers. This isn’t a far-fetched science fiction tale. 
Terraforming Mars is possible, on the kind of   time scale our ancestors built great monuments 
in. If humanity solves some of its pressing   problems and ventures into space to expand into 
the solar system, this may not be that far off. Ok. So how do we terraform Mars 
quickly? Well, It’s complicated. Mars is dry and has no soil to grow anything. Its 
atmosphere is too thin to breathe or protect from   radiation, giving you a high risk of cancer. 
So to turn it into a new home for humanity,   we have to give it a proper atmosphere, similar 
to Earth’s. It should be made of 21% oxygen,   79% nitrogen and a tiny bit of CO2, at an average 
temperature of 14°C and under 1 bar of pressure. We have to create oceans and rivers and then the 
ground has to be weathered into fertile soil to   host living things. Then we need to install 
a biosphere on the surface and prevent it all   from being undone by installing protective 
measures that can stand the test of time. It’s difficult. But a big 
laser makes it a lot easier. Challenge 1: The Atmosphere Some 4 billion years ago Mars had a nice 
oxygen-rich atmosphere and was home to vast   oceans and rivers. It held onto it for 
several hundred million years before it   got blown away. Ultraviolet rays broke down 
the atmospheric gases and then the oceans,   until they were swept away by solar wind. 
Today Mars is a dry, barren wasteland. Luckily a sizable portion of the water is frozen 
in deep reservoirs and in the polar ice caps,   enough to create a very shallow ocean. 
And enormous amounts of oxygen are bound   as minerals in the Martian rocks, 
like the oxygen in the iron oxides   that give the planet its rust-red colour, 
as well as carbon dioxide in carbonates. To free these gases, we need to 
reverse the reactions that lock   them away by using thermolysis, 
which occurs at temperatures as   high as on the surface of the Sun. In 
short, we want to melt Mars’ surface. The best way to do that would be to put lasers 
in orbit aiming their beams down on Mars.   The most powerful laser today is the ELI-NP,   able to produce beams of 10 Petawatts 
of power, for a trillionth second. To melt Mars we need a laser twice as powerful, 
that runs continuously. The easiest way is to use   a solar-pumped laser that can be powered directly 
with sunlight: At its core are metal-infused glass   rods that absorb energy and release it as a laser 
beam. If we build an array of mirrors in space,   about 11 times the size of the United States, we 
can focus enough sunlight onto them to melt Mars. Let’s do it! As the lasers hit the surface, about 750 
kg of oxygen and some carbon dioxide emerge   from every cubic meter of rock melted. If 
we are efficient our lasers only need to   melt through the top 8 meters of 
the surface to get enough oxygen. It would look terrifying. The 
skies would be shrouded in storms,   while the ground would glow red-hot, 
criss-crossed by currents of lava.   Tireless laser beams sweep over the landscape, 
leaving trails too bright to look at. After they   pass, the ground cools quickly. A strange 
snow falls: the ashes from all the elements   that solidify as they cool down, like silicon and 
iron. Mars is still a cold planet at this point. A happy side effect of this inferno is that 
all the water in the polar ice caps and even   deep underground rises into the sky as hot 
steam, forming clouds that rain down over   the entire planet. They would wash out 
the nastier gases from the atmosphere,   like chlorine, and carry away harmful elements 
that accumulated on the surface. In the end, they   would form shallow oceans, saltier than on Earth. 
We might need to do an extra clean-up afterwards. It would take about 50 years of continuous 
lasering to create our oxygen atmosphere. We   could use this opportunity to dig deeper in some 
places to create the basins for salty oceans or   rivers and spare some landmark features 
like Mons Olympus and Valles Marineris. We’re not done though. The resulting atmosphere is nearly 100% 
oxygen and only 0.2 bar. It’s hard to   breathe and very flammable. To make 
it similar to earth and a lot safer,   we need to add a lot of nitrogen, which 
Mars is lacking sadly. We have to import it. The ideal source is Titan, a large moon of Saturn, 
covered in a thick atmosphere that’s almost   entirely nitrogen. We just have to move 3000 
trillion tons from the outer solar system to Mars. While that’s not easy, it is doable. To 
process that much of Titan’s atmosphere,   we have to construct giant automated factories, 
on its surface powered by our lasers to suck in   the atmosphere and compress it into a liquid. 
This gets pumped into bullet-shaped tanks,   which a mass driver shoots all the way to 
the red planet, where they explode and mix   with the oxygen. We’ve already been able to send 
individual missions to Saturn in just a few years.   With enough resources, it should be possible 
to complete the task within 2 generations.  Of course it would be much more 
convenient to have nitrogen left   over from terraforming Venus on the side: we 
explained this in detail in another video. So, about a century after the 
start of the terraforming process,   we have a breathable atmosphere that has 
the right gases. If the liberated CO2   isn't enough to warm it up to temperatures we 
can stand, we just add some super greenhouse   gases. Mars at this point resembles a 
black marble from all the cooling lava,   spotted with growing oceans and red patches 
where the old surface remains untouched. It’s   still a wasteland, no better than a desert 
on Earth. We need to fill it with life. Challenge 2: Biosphere Installing a biosphere on a new planet is 
very difficult. Unexpected interactions   between species or sudden diseases can 
destabilise it to the point of collapse. We would probably begin by seeding our young 
oceans with phytoplankton. Without competition,   it would bloom rapidly, filling up the oceans 
to become the bottom of an aquatic food chain.   They can be followed by tiny zooplankton,   then by fish. Maybe even sharks and whales. If 
things go well, life in the oceans will thrive. Life on land is harder. Plants need 
nutrient-filled ground to sink their roots   into. But most of the surface is the congealed 
remains of lava and ashes. We could wait for   thousands of years for water and wind to grind it 
down into finer sands or try to do it manually. But we want to be quick. And we have a 
big laser. Turning the beam on and off   in rapid succession would cause the ground to 
quickly heat up and contract, which breaks it   into smaller and smaller pieces. Add a bit 
of water, and you get a sort of dark mud. Into this mud, we can mix fungi and 
nitrogen-fixing bacteria. They’re   able to absorb nitrogen and convert it 
into nitrate compounds to feed plants.   The first plants we want to bring are 
native to volcanic islands on Earth,   since they are perfectly suited to 
the laser-blasted Martian landscape. Eventually, the enriched mud becomes the 
foundation for grasslands and forests. In   Mars’ lower gravity, trees can become very tall 
very fast. Their roots gather the nutrients   they need and then dig deeper to turn more rocks 
into soil, forming a self-sustaining ecosystem. At this point we can slowly introduce more plant 
varieties, insects and animals. Not mosquitoes   though. The new biosphere needs to be maintained 
to prevent it from falling out of balance. If   plants grow too quickly and absorb too much 
carbon dioxide, the planet cools down too much.   If key species die out, we could see populations 
collapse faster than they could recover. On Earth,   other species would move in to fill the void, 
but our Martian biosphere is not as flexible. It takes hundreds if not thousands of years 
before Mars becomes a stable environment. But eventually the planet will have the potential 
to sustain large human colonies. With air,   water and food available, we 
can finally call Mars – black,   blue and green – our home. A 
giant, volcanic island in space. Will it last though? Challenge 3: The long-term future There is a problem we haven’t addressed: Mars’ 
core does not produce a magnetic field, so it does   not have enough protection from solar radiation 
or cosmic rays. This becomes dangerous for the   long term health of Martian populations. So as a 
final step, we need an artificial magnetic field. It doesn’t have to be huge like Earth’s. It   just needs to deflect the solar wind 
enough so that it doesn’t touch Mars. The easiest way is to construct a magnetic 
umbrella far ahead of Mars that splashes the solar   wind to the sides. A big, superconducting ring 
powered by nuclear facilities is all it takes.   It would orbit at the Mars-Sun L1 
point, keeping it constantly in   between the Sun and Mars and protect 
the new atmosphere. And that’s it! Terraforming Mars would take some work, 
hefty resources and probably a century or   ten but it would be the first time

Qsbe1pD8ocE,2022-12-06T15:52:00.000000,The Horror of the Slaver Ant,"everything changed when the slaver Nation attacked what used to be a thriving colony is now a captured country slaves do the work serving their new Masters until they die only to be replaced by new victims harvested in brutal raids but let's go back to the [Music] beginning the world war of the ants is ging millions of lives every day but in the brutal world of ants straight up war is not the only way around 50 ant species practice slavery the most extreme division of labor we don't know how this began but some ant species perfected this cruel trade meet polyergus the most intense of the slaver ant tribes there are different species but generally they're 4 to 10 mm long with brown to blackish bodies and sickle shaped mandibles polyergus has specialized in slavery so much that they've lost their ability to care for themselves they don't clean build nests care for their brood or feed themselves they only exist for raiding slaves make up 82 90% of the ants in their colonies so a few hundred polyergus and a single queen control thousands of slave ants we'll summarize and simplify what we know about pogus into one Grand Story you can find find more information in our sources so now let's witness the cruel banality of nature The Raid it all begins on a mild Summer Morning on a sunny field witness this colony of over 10,000 for Mica ants genetically cousins of polyergus who build a thriving Nest underground they are a widespread genus some species are good Fighters some great Builders and some cattle Farmers often welcomed by humans because they hunt Vermin that hurt forests nobody noticed the lone polya Scout that briefly showed up this morning before she bolted away again the attack begins in the early afternoon the Scout returns from her mission to find the for Mica nests she dances erratically and spreads pheromones that excite and mass recruit more and more rants until a large raiding party of a thousand Warrior 's has formed a close-packed well organized column up to 10 m long begins to move as the polyus raiding party arrives at the for Mica Colony the attack begins almost immediately dozens of attackers begin digging and clearing up debris from The Nest entrance to make it easier to storm as soon as they're done hundreds of the attackers Rush inside the Defenders vastly outnumber their attackers and are formidable Warriors able to shoot AET but instead of fighting back effectively they seem confused and Scatter rather than fighting back Urus also seems to be somewhat resistant to the acid sprays of the Defenders and so even if a defense is forming the attackers use their mandibles to pierce and kill there are a few different ideas as to why polyus attacks are so efficient and one of the most fascinating ones is chemical warfare instead of relying on Brute Force they release a propaganda pheromone that makes the Defenders Panic unable to mount an organized defense the attackers have nothing to gain from intense and toand combat other than immense casualties what's more they actually want their victims to survive so that they can be raided again in a few weeks as the raid unfolds the attackers breach deep into the colony looking for their most valuable possession The Colony babies they grab the pupy and na'vi that will make up the next generation of for Mica and carry them out of the nest hundreds are abducted and brought back to the polyus colony in this rate alone well most of them a few unlucky ones are eaten as a sort of snack the surviving victims will be turned into slaves after about an hour The Raid is over and the for Mica can begin to recover it seems their only strategy is to make even more ants a decent sized Colony can forfeit thousands of PE in a single raiding season and still survive although in this case while the raid was going on something even more Sinister happened hold that thought though because how are polyergus turning ants into slaves how to brainwash ant slaves ants conquered almost the entire planet over 100 million years ago they owe their success to being social animals that perfected chemical communication chemical signals and cues let ants know what their colony needs and what each individual should do and most importantly in this case who is a friend or Foe slave making ants are much less social than other ant species some species miss a lot of the genes other ants have to make communication possible in a sense they are bad at talking to each other so it may be that as polya's ancestors started to abduct other ants they lost the ability to collaborate and work together productively soon after the stolen for Mica Offspring have been brought to the slaver Colony they are progressively covered in polyergus pheromones they are chemically imprinted similar to a duckling who imprints on a Mother after birth when the New Slaves hatch they behave as though they are part of the polyus colony and begin to work for them unconditionally keeping the nest clean caring for the next generation of slaves and Masters hunting for food and feeding their enslavers mouth to mouth this sort of brainwashing goes so far that if they encounter free for M ANS in the world they will treat them as enemies in a sense they're not true slaves as they serve willingly and show no interest in Freedom it's more more like violent abduction and adoption which doesn't make things that much better and as the forer only live for a few months a constant new supply of victims is necessary to survive polyus can never stop enslaving how to make new slave colonies how are new polyergus colonies created after all polyergus workers are so useless that a queen can't start a new Colony without slaves but how does she make slaves without Warriors it turns out there are two main strategies the more dangerous one might unfold during a raid like the one we witnessed before a young polyus Queen silently follows the raiding party using the chaos of the invasion she's able to find her way to the for Mica Queen and kill her taking over the shaken Colony although such a victory may be very shortlived poly ogers do not tolerate other slaver colonies within their hunting ground they raid each other fiercely too and can destroy the competing colon is nearby so while this tactic sometimes works it is pretty dangerous another young Queen is going for a different strategy she's looking for a formica Colony that is further from her birthplace attacking a whole Colony on her own she bols through an entrance pushing aside confused ants that try to stop her releasing a powerful appeasement pheromone that drives Defenders away she has only a short time window to find the for Mica Queen deep in the Hostile Nest once she finds her Target both Queens engage in a fight to the death The polyergus Queen Is Well equipped with her sharp Mandall she bites and rips into her victim for about half an hour before she finally calms down between her bites she licks the chemical surface of the Dead formica Queen covering herself in her pheromones when she's done with this macabra ritual fora workers approach her subdued by her intense smells they start grooming and feeding her as though pledging their allegiance to their new ruler she still might not be done though for mic colonies often have multiple Queens who all need to be defeated which is not guaranteed often attacking Queens will be stopped by a falance of workers that rip her apart or are defeated in royal battle but if she does manage to kill all the Queens The Colony has been taken over and the enslaved brood will begin to serve a new Queen the usurper she now begins laying eggs that are cared for by her New Slaves until New polyergus ants hatch that will soon start new raids on neighboring colonies no matter what we humans do quietly below our feet the world war of the ants is Raging with wild and horrible strategies fought by billions of individuals every single day polyergus will continue to hunt for slaves as to stop raiding would be their demise and in the war of the ants there is no giving up"
q4DF3j4saCE,2022-11-23T15:00:13.000000,The Most Extreme Explosion in the Universe,"supern noi are the most powerful explosions in the universe unleashing enough energy to outshine galaxies we have no real metaphor for their power if the sun were to magically go supernova it would feel like you were being hit by the energy of a nuclear explosion every second for weeks while supern noi are the engines of creation forging the elements that enable life they also burn sterile whole regions of galaxies so what would happen if if one hit [Music] Earth there are roughly speaking two ways to make a supernova either the core of a massive star implodes or less common a white dwarf gains Mass to the point where it ignites explosive nuclear fusion the outcome is the same a supernova explosion when we think of an explosion on Earth we think of something that happens fast and ends but a supernova is more likely volcanic eruption followed by a tsunami at first there's a colorful ball of hot expanding gas creating a spectacular Cloud that will shine for about a month but then it doesn't stop hot and dangerous gas rushes outwards at speeds of 10,000 km a second through the near vacuum of space sweeping up the sparse gas of the Galaxy this wall of gas expands for tens of thousands of years and will eventually span up to dozens of light years until it finally cools off and disperses its substance back into the Galaxy so what if this star tsunami hits us well the damage depends on how far away it is stage one thousands of light years away humans have witnessed dozens of supern noi but all of them were thousands of light years away they appeared as new stars some outshining the moon twinkling for a few weeks and disappearing aside from looking very pretty at this distance they don't do much to us stage two 300 light years away things begin to get a bit icky once a supernova occurs around 300 light years away we can expect one this close to us every few million years a single star giving the night sky an eerie glow like Twilight and while this is far enough away and dim enough to not do harm to us they can affect the Earth at these distances it's like being hit by the last weak waves of the star tsunami not strong enough to do real damage but still noticeable in fact we know that over the past 10 million years multiple supern noi have struck Earth from these distances because we can find radioactive isotopes of iron deep in the rocks and sediments at the bottom of the ocean amazingly these Supernova around the solar system have cleared a 1,000 Lightyear wide pocket of space that's called the local bubble they blew away the interstellar gas and dust creating a lumpy wall of gas that's now a cradle for Star formation stage three 150 light years away once a supernova happens much closer than 300 light years we're approaching the Zone where it does real damage stars have extremely powerful magnetic fields when they die the tsunami of dead star actually retains a lot of this magnetic energy woven through the shock wave that expands outwards in this highly magnetized Cloud we get like in a huge particle accelerator that's accelerating charged particles like protons nuclei and electrons to immense speeds which means we have an expanding Cloud that is shooting deadly radiation in all directions long after the bright light from the initial explosion has faded away if a supernova happens too close by waves of these cosmic rays will wash over the solar system for thousands of years while we're mostly protected on Earth's surface by the atmosphere and ozone layer the influx of extra radiation will still increase cancer and mutation rates not enough to cause a mass extinction but it will be noticeable space flight would become impossible in the solar system as astronauts wouldn't survive the waves of radiation for long we don't know exactly how bad this would be but a supernova that is close enough May trap our species on Earth for Generations maybe thousands of years it only gets worse from here stage four closer than 100 light years within 100 light years things get bad as a supernova disrupts our climate in ways that we don't fully understand yet there are a few unpleasant things happening all one after another first the high energy photons arrive from the explosion followed by many decades of radiation from the radioactive tsunami both of which seriously damage the ozone layer Earth's shield against harmful radiation the ozone layer absorbs ultraviolet radiation by breaking apart ozone o03 into O2 and a free oxygen atom which later reforms back into another ozone molecule but the Supernova radiation breaks up nitrogen molecules that gobble up the free oxygen breaking the cycle and depleting the ozone layer quickly without a radiation Shield everybody living on the surface is exposed to very high levels of UV radiation from our sun cancer rates would Skyrocket and just going outside during the day could be life-threatening the extra radiation would also kill a lot if not most of the plankton in the oceans that live near the surface and are the basis for the marine food chains leading to a mass extinction worse still Supernova radiation would ionize gas in the atmosphere which means that it would punch through molecules and knock electrons off nuclei leaving them charged these charged nuclei then act as seeds for water vapor to gather and form massive Global clouds in the worst case they would reflect enough sunlight to trigger an ice age in fact it's thought that the Ice Age 2 and A2 million years ago was caused by a supernova some scientists even think that a supernova about 60 light years away might have been the cause of the devonian mass extinction 350 million years ago but wait there's more the electrons punched free by the radiation form enormous electric Avalanches or in other words lightning Earth is hit by some of the worst thunderstorms in millions of years the intense lightning causes global wildfires that consume forests and crops devastate cities disrupt our electrical grids and Global Supply chains all while a decimated ozone layer leaks deadly radiation while in the past the ecosystem may have bounced back from a nearby Supernova after a few thousand or million years there's no guarantee modern civilization can take a hit of this magnitude we would face food shortages skyrocketing prices and Wars as Nations struggle to not be consumed by chaos so a supernova this close would at the very least do significant damage for hundreds or thousands of years if not end our modern civilization and with it millions or even billions of lives still Humanity would likely survive and could recover stage five closer than 25 light years a supernova closer than 25 light years means that we're in its kill radius where a mass extinction is all but guaranteed probably about half of the ozone layer would be destroyed and massive climactic disruption on a scale we've never witnessed would ravage Earth entire ecosystem systems would swiftly be wiped out by radiation AS Global wildfires envelop the planet all the things described before happen but way more intensely and much faster a few people might survive for years in bunkers if they have food supplies but the world they return to will be devastated and hostile to life for hundreds of thousands of years human extinction is extremely likely final stage four light years being any closer to a supernova is very unlikely because space is big but the effects would be extreme even from 4light years away the distance to Alpha centuri a supernova would be almost as bright as the sun in the sky while casting two Shadows could be fun for a few hours within days the Earth's surface gets as hot as a sauner baking the surface for weeks until the explosion Fades the surface of Earth Burns scared of life even the oceans aren't safe the massive amount of radiation that follows Burns away the ozone layer killing everything that sees sunlight it would be the largest Extinction event in history reducing life to a few survivers in the deep sea and critters in the Deep soil life basically has to start over conclusion how worried do you need to be so should you worry no fortunately there are only a handful of stars that may explode within 1,000 light years of Earth and none are close enough to be a serious threat even better better these Stars will probably not go supernova for many millions of years so you are safe but there's no guarantee for the far future as stars orbit the Galaxy our descendants may find themselves dangerously close to a supernova but by then a far more advanced and wiser Humanity will hopefully be able to just move out of the way in any case you can sleep well tonight under the beautiful night sky"
Us2Z-WC9rao,2022-11-08T14:59:18.000000,Why Don't We Shoot Nuclear Waste Into Space?,"here in the kotart labs we test very important ideas to see what happens when you blow things up or play with black holes many of you suggested that we look into an idea that sounds reasonable shooting nuclear waste into space it's one of those Concepts that seems like an easy fix for one of the main problems with the nuclear energy but it turns out this idea is not just bad but horribly bad and it gets worse the longer you think about it why is that [Music] what is nuclear waste nuclear waste is a fuzzy term and comes in categories which vary from country to country but in general there are three broad levels 90% is lowlevel nuclear waste tools gloves or trash used at a nuclear facility that could be weakly contaminated with some short-lived radioactivity this stuff is generally safe for normal disposal 7% is intermediate level nuclear waste mostly materials that have been in close proximity to a reactor core long enough to become dangerously Radioactive with proper handling it's either safely buried or melted down and mixed into glass or concrete and stored deep underground so 97% of nuclear waste is similar to toxic byproducts from other Industries not great not terrible we can handle it the remaining 3% is where our problems begin highlevel nuclear waste is very concentrated spent fuel taken out of a reactor core formerly uranium it's now made of various dangerous and often highly radioactive elements as a bonus it's also incredibly hot and not easy to handle at all this is what we want to shoot into space All In All Around 440 active nuclear reactors create about 11,000 tons of high level nuclear waste each year since 195 54 we've accumulated 400,000 tons of dangerous radioactive waste most countries are dealing with it by not dealing with it and kicking the can towards the future great so let's launch it into space according to scientists space is big and nobody lives there so it seems perfect for yeting away this mess there are a few tiny problems though problem one stuff ain't cheap even though space light is getting more affordable it's still extremely expensive just to get something into low earth orbit costs on average about $4,000 per kog putting that into perspective it costs about $1,600 to mine separate and fabricate 1 kg of nuclear fuel so launching waste into space has suddenly made nuclear fuel for reactors way more expensive and greatly increased the cost of the electricity they produce to launch one reactor worth of nuclear waste would cost at least $100 million per year to deal with all the 440 operational nuclear power plants high level nuclear waste would cost some $44 billion per year for space launch before packaging transport and security costs are added okay let's pretend we don't care currently we couldn't shoot all the nuclear waste into space even if we wanted to there just aren't enough rockets in 2021 we saw a record 35 launches into space if we repurposed each of those rockets and filled them all with nuclear waste the total amount that could be lifted into a low earth orbit which is the closest orbit above the atmosphere is nearly 800 tons we'd need at least 14 times more Rockets to handle just today's nuclear waste let alone get rid of the hundreds of thousands of tons in temporary storage we would need to create entire new Space Industries to keep up with the demand for giant toxic Space trash trucks and it gets worse problem two space is hard we only made the calculation for low earth orbit where we send most of our rockets and satellites littering the space around Earth with thousands of cks of spent nuclear fuel would be a nightmare for space junk management and satellite collision avoidance worse still at this altitude there's still a little bit of atmosphere causing a tiny bit of drag so we might have nuclear waste raining down from space within just a few years experts would call this a huge problem clearly we have to launch our waste further if we wanted to send it to perhaps the moon we either need way more Rockets or we need to build much bigger ones making it even more expensive a single Saturn 5 the rocket used by the Apollo program which cost around 1.5 billion adjusted for inflation per launch could get about 43.5 tons from the earth to the moon so we'd need about 260 Saturn f rocket launches every year and of course using the Luna's target practice for nuclear waste tipped Rockets kind of makes a huge mess so maybe don't aim for anything space is empty do we really need a target shooting waste in any random direction is you guessed it also a bad idea orbits are Loops which means they have a tendency to come back to where they started put enough in the sky in random directions and you'll get one back eventually so we'd want to launch our nuclear waste deep into space which means we need even bigger rockets that would be even more expensive not that we would be completely safe then Earth might run into these interplanetary caskets at some time in the far future and experience a pretty meteor shower made from radioactive dust okay how about we shoot it into the sun ironically the sun is pretty hard to hit while the sun has very strong gravity everything on Earth is moving with respect to the Sun including the rockets that we launch meaning a rocket would have to cancel out all the orbital motion it has around the Sun so it can stop orbiting and fall in because of this it's actually easier to launch a rocket entirely out of the solar system than it is to launch it into the Sun but to do either of these things we need even bigger Rockets probably the biggest we've ever built H nothing works the thing is it gets even worse problem three rockets go rocket engineering has taken huge steps since the Apollo era we've made them relatively safe we've mostly replaced the toxic explosive cancer fuels of the past decades with much sailor mixes of liquid oxygen and hydrogen or kerosene the newest designs even land themselves so that they can be reused and yet out of the 146 launches in 2021 there were 11 failures which means that a sizable number of our Rockets carrying high level radioactive waste would be exploding on the Launchpad or in the worst case disassembling at high altitude or crashing from Hypersonic speeds each failure would be at least equivalent to a miniature Noble but instead of being contained under a slab of concrete spread throughout the atmosphere radioactive particles could make their way to far away places by riding on the winds most would fall into the ocean but some would land on the inhabited parts of the world they could cover farmlands and get concentrated into our food or enter our water supply which is well bad imagine regular large- scale nuclear disasters happening people wouldn't be happy conclusion and opinion part nuclear waste is scary but the fear of it and horrible ideas like shooting it into space reveals how bad we are at understanding risk because the largest amounts of radioactive elements Like Ur ium and radon are actually released by coal burning millions of tons of coal each year leaves Ash as a waste product that includes about 36,000 tons of radioactive materials less radioactive than high level nuclear waste but there's also a lot more of it and it's handled way less carefully some of this ash is caught by filters but most is simply pushed back into leaky mines shoved into piles exposed to the wind or poured into ponds that regularly spill into rivers and Lakes living within 1.6 km of an ash pile increases your cancer risk up to 2,000 times over the acceptable limit and this is on top of other toxic chemicals like heavy metals and of course their massive CO2 emissions and yet while nuclear energy is flawed and its current form may only be a transitory technology nuclear power plants are a harder cell than coal nuclear waste and the lack of willingness to deal with it are a real issue it's not not insurmountable though there are good methods to handle it like burying it deep underground or reprocessing some of it into new fuel but however we ultimately deal with this issue we hope one thing is clear shooting nuclear waste into space is one of the worst ideas ever researching this

fXb02MQ78yQ,2022-10-18T13:59:41.000000,The Biggest Eruptions That Changed Earth Forever,"the Earth is a gigantic ball of semi molten rock with a heart of iron as hot as the surface of the Sun Titanic amounts of heat left over from its birth and the radioactive decay of trillions of tons of radioactive elements find No Escape but up currents of rock spanning thousands of kilometers carry this energy to the surface Earth's crust is the only thing in their way it feels solid to us but it's only a fragile barrier an apple skin around the claiming Behemoth true apocalypses can break through and unleash eruptions tens of times more powerful than all of our nuclear weapons combined subjecting the climate to centuries worth of change in a single year while drowning continents in toxic Ash and gases super volcanoes how big can they get and will they put an end to humanity [Music] volcanoes there are many types of volcanoes from towering mountains to lava domes but they have two main sources the first is at the boundaries between tectonic plates the pieces of the crust that cover the Earth like a giant jigsaw puzzle there are seven major tectonic plates and dozens of smaller ones drifting against each other at up to 15 cm per year this sounds slow but on geological time scales it is a Titanic struggle over who gets to stay on the surface the winning plate crumbles into a new mountain range while the loser is shoved underneath into an ocean of hot rock at 1300° C the asthenosphere the temperature here is enough to melt rock into a liquid but the insane pressures of all that mass keep it a superheated solid tectonic plates are usually in contact with water for thousands of years and absorb some of it when they're submerged into the hot underworld this water triggers chemical Transformations that allow tiny portions to melt into magma liquid magma is less dense than Solid Rock so it rises to the surface in Furious bubbles that accumulate in sponge-like reservoirs right under the crust if enough magma accumulates it becomes powerful enough to pierce through the crust which we experience as volcanoes this happens under the winning plate like a Revenge attack by the loser before it's erased forever the second main source of volcanoes are thought to be mantle plumes these are columns of abnormally hot rock that rise all the way from the planet's core mantle boundary to the surface much less is known about them but in a way it's as if the Earth's mantle has weather patterns and mantle plumes are a little like hot air rising to form storm clouds storms hundreds of millions of years old made of rocks circulating at a rate of a few millimet per month they don't care about the motion of tectonic plates so they can break the crust to create volcanoes in the middle of nowhere that stubbornly stay active as the crust shifts around them the volcanic boom meter scientists love to put big booms on a scale and came up with a logarithmic scale that measures the volume ejected during an eruption the volcanic explosivity index or VII simply put it starts really small and gets very big very quickly a vii2 eruption would fill 400 full Olympic swimming pools with lava we have around 10 of these per year at vii3 we already see devastating effects like the eruption of the samaru volcano in 2021 that destroyed thousands of homes in Indonesia at vii5 we see catastrophic amounts of materials cubic kilometers of debris equivalent to an entire Lake of molten rock blasted into the air like the 2022 hunga Tonga hunga haai eruption that sent a shock wave around the globe many times and created ocean white tsunamis at a VII of six an eruption can change the world in 1883 the Indonesian island volcano katoa erupted nearly continuously over the course of 5 months one of those eruptions blew it apart producing the loudest sound recorded in history 10 trillion times louder than a Rocket taking off heard Halfway Around the World 30 m High tsunamis Swept Away nearby populations and so much gas and Ash were released the global temperatures cooled by nearly 0.5° C red Dusty sunsets followed for many years at vii7 we get super colossal eruptions Millennium defining events that human civilization has only encountered a handful of times Mount tamboro was a 4,300 m high mountain until it exploded in 1815 and released 400 times more energy than the tar bomber 140 billion tons of Ash and dust was shot halfway to space before smothering the world's skies turning them a sickly yellow there was no summer the following year crops died and over a 100,000 people perished this is the Dreadful potential of volcanic eruptions with famines across the other side of the world and even centuries Long Cold periods being attributed to them okay but what's a super volcano the term super volcano is a meteor invention and not a scientific term the main issue with them is that not every eruption from a super volcano is a super eruption what makes super volcanoes special is that they've been waiting to erupt for hundreds of thousands of years pressure buil up in colossal magma reservoirs several kilometers deep until it becomes strong enough to lift the rock Above It by several meters rocks crack under the pressure until they finally give way and billions of tons of gas and Ash blast out at supersonic speed an insane explosion of at least 1,000 cubic km that impacts every corner of the globe and yet that is only a small portion of the magma Reservoir super eruptions are like a Boiling Pot of water popping its lid off and spitting a bit off the top afterwards the ground collapses into the void Left Behind forming a hole called a Caldera under this Caldera pressure starts building again until the volcano gathers enough energy for another Super eruption but this could take hundreds of thousands of years it's estimated that one of the few volcanoes capable of super eruptions on Earth could cause a catastrophic eruption every 177,000 years on average that would make them far more frequent than comparable asteroid impacts the most recent super eruption is the orui eruption 26,500 years ago in New Zealand with the force of dozens of billions of tons of TNT a Mount Everest sized pile of explosives a huge portion of the landscape was scooped out and thrown into the atmosphere left behind a Caldera spanning 20 km and it caused the entire southern hemisphere to undergo a period of abrupt cooling though among super eruptions it's a mere Firework the lake Tober eruption of 74,000 years ago was a much more significant turning point in history it released a gargantuan 5,300 Cub km of material enough to blanket parts of South Asia in 15 cm of Ash and trigger a rapid 4° C drop in global temperatures it's possible that the volcanic winter lasted 10 years followed by worldwide droughts for centuries Earth's climate might have not recovered for a thousand years the largest volcanic events we know of were not really huge explosions but floods of millions of cubic kilm of lava the grand finale with a Siberian traps around 250 million years ago a continuous release of lava for 2 million years they raised the ocean temperatures to over 40° C which caused the permium Triassic Extinction killing over 90% of all species Earth's surface needed 9 million years to recover these sorts of eruptions don't change the climate they are the climate but thankfully we haven't seen anything even remotely close to that scale in many millions of years so should you be scared of super volcanoes definitely not they've been used to frighten many people and are overhyped as an unavoidable apocalypse the most famous One Yellowstone will erupt again but they will be relatively small eruptions natural disasters for sure but not enough to devastate the us or come close to ending Humanity the chance of a vi8 eruption in the next few hundred years is less than 2% and more importantly it wouldn't come as a sudden surprise however less powerful but more frequent eruptions can also do serious damage to our civilizations and are in many way ways a much greater concern so we must watch for slow changes in magma reservoirs like ground swelling and temperature increases to get an early warning that can save the lives of people living the closest to a volcano and there's time to develop solutions that can remove sulfur and Ash from the stratosphere to eliminate the root cause of the climate disruption we've seen from previous eruptions who knows maybe we'll even be able to turn this force of Destruction into an agent for Good by exploiting the geotherm energy held in their giant magma reservoirs we've done this work for so many other disasters and we are already doing things we could only have dreamed about decades ago like sending a probe to perform our first asteroid redirection test with determination Humanity really can solve anything so while deep below us an angry hell is churning and waiting for its moment you can sleep well tonight"
FfWtIaDtfYk,2022-10-04T14:00:33.000000,Let’s Travel to The Most Extreme Place in The Universe,"The universe is pretty big and very strange. Hundreds of billions of galaxies with sextillions
of stars and planets and in the middle of it all there is earth, with you and us. But as enormous as the universe seems looking
up, it seems to get even larger when you start looking down. You are towering over worlds within worlds,
within worlds – each in plain sight and yet hidden from your experience. Let’s go on a journey – we’ll start
in a park, about a thousand meters long, enough for a 15 minute walk. Every time we click this magic button, we’ll
become a thousand times smaller. Please slip into this magic science suit,
so you don’t die and can still see. Ready? Let’s go. click The Miniature Realm You are the size of a grain of sand just 2
mm high, standing on a blade of grass that seems as tall as an eight storey building
to you. A square meter of lawn is now a dense metropolitan
area, with 100,000 blades, or two Manhattans worth of grass towers. From your new tiny perspective, the park that
you could quickly stroll through before, is now the size of France. Crossing it would take at least a week. Human sized humans loom over you, 4 times
taller than the Empire state building, their steps falling from horizon to horizon. A bee the size of a helicopter lands near
you, making the ground shake, as its hairy carapace vibrates with each wingbeat. You try to escape but are barely able to move
because the air is so… gooey. Before you clicked the button air resistance
was barely noticeable – but as you’re now a thousand times smaller, it is as if
the air has become a thousand times denser. It feels like you are moving through honey. Flying insects like bees use this to their
advantage. Their wings are not made for gliding but like
paddles that row through the air. Scaled up to human size, the bee would outrun
a Concorde Jet – except it couldn’t even take off because it would be too heavy for
its wings. click The Microscopic Realm You’ve entered the microscopic realm and
are now less than 2 micrometers tall, about the size of an e coli bacteria. From your new tiny perspective, the park you
started in is now a million kilometers wide to you – if you walked non stop it would
take some 25 years to cross it. It is hard to grasp just how huge the microscopic
world is to its tiny inhabitants. The giant bee that was close a moment ago,
is now the size of Mt. Everest, towering high into the sky – but
alive, humming and vibrating. The air here feels almost solid to you, on
the human scale it would be as viscous as lava, extremely hard to push through. The blade of grass now expands so far you
can’t see its edges, stretching as wide as Paris would to a regular sized human. You see valleys that look like dried up riverbeds,
dead patches like deserts and giant craters left behind by voracious aphids. But if you look closely, this is not terrain. These are rows of individual cells, each the
size of a house with hard exteriors like glass shells. Every few cells, there are huge openings called
stomata, like mouths, sucking in air and blowing out oxygen. Suddenly the gigantic bee begins to move – a
construct made of rigid pieces that slide against each other, like a suit of armor. It takes off to escape a drop of water the
size of an Asteroid, that fell from another blade of grass and is now rushing at you at
breathtaking speeds. You brace for impact but instead of feeling
a strong punch you just get sucked in. You try to swim but the water feels thick
and sticky and holds onto your limbs like glue. Air molecules are free spirits while water
molecules act more like social creatures that group together whenever possible. They pull on each other and create a relatively
strong cohesive force that traps you. You can’t help it but you are still moving,
tumbling in all directions, helplessly dragged along by an invisible current. Floating in this miniature lake are tens of
thousands of micro-organisms. They take on many forms – viruses the size
of tennis balls float around you aimlessly, others like the Euglena oxyuris cells which
pass you like freight trains. But most look like oily jellyfish the size
of a car, sporting long tentacles that act like super charged propellers. Despite the water holding onto them like glue,
some move hundreds of body lengths per second, equivalent to a person shovelling through
mud at over 600 km/h. However bacteria weigh so little and water
is so viscous that they basically have no inertia – there is no gliding on this scale. The result is a weird jerky motion that’s
hard to keep track of. Maybe we can learn more about this strange
motion if we go even deeper. click Molecule Realm You’ve become the size of a molecule, just
under two nanometers wide. At your new tiny scale, the droplet now seems
as big as the Moon to a regular human. The blade of grass it rests on could reach
from the tip of Alaska to the end of Australia, and the park is now almost the size of the
Solar System – but instead of mostly empty space, it is filled with stuff. Everywhere you look, there are innumerable
amounts of molecules and atoms. The rigid walls of the grass cells beneath
you are clearly vibrating, rippling with waves of energy. The water droplet contains nearly a sextillion
water molecules that are all in motion. Water is actually a storm of H2O molecules
smashing into each other hundreds of trillions of times a second. Each of them is moving at speeds of around
2300 km/h and bombard their surroundings mercilessly, sending small objects hurtling in all directions. This is the source of the invisible current
that you noticed when you were a thousand times larger. Scaling this speed up to the human scale is
impossible, as a human sized molecule would be 2000 times faster than the speed of light. All this furious motion comes from heat. Heat is a bit abstract at our human scale,
where you touch something and get a vague sense of whether it is hot or cold. But down here, you really feel what ‘heat’
is: the motion of molecules, vibrating, twisting and colliding as if they’re inside a furious
ballpit. When these molecules lose heat, they move
more slowly and collide less often. When they gain heat, they speed up and smash
together with renewed fervour. Temperature is basically the measure of the
average speed of these fantastic dancers performing all day. Suddenly a molecule hits you especially hard
and you are catapulted out of the water droplet into the air again. And here you see something unexpected: The
stuff between the air molecules: Nothing. Between the molecules that make up the air
there is a vacuum. On average a molecule in the air travels for
about 60 nanometers, which is about the length of a hockey rink if it were the size of a
human. If we were to compress all the molecules and
atoms buzzing around in the room you are watching this in, they would only fill about 0.1% of
its volume. 99.9% of the space around you is a vacuum,
you just don’t notice it. Which also means that every time you take
a breath, you breathe in mostly nothing with a few atoms. Click Subatomic Realm At your size of under 2 picometers, scale
starts to lose its meaning. A human would be nearly 2 billion kilometers
tall relative to you, so large they could stretch their arms from the Sun to Saturn. An atomic nucleus would be the size of a grain
of sand you could hold on the tip of your finger. That grain holds 99.97% of the atom’s mass. The rest, a sphere of influence about as large
as the Eiffel tower from your perspective, is filled with an electron cloud. That’s basically all the places where electrons
might be at any given moment in time. Electrons are shapeshifters that morph around
outside a nucleus, creating a new and vibrating mess of different shapes with every new moment. Unlike the graceful motion of planets, the
atomic nuclei are chaotic blurs. They bulge, roll, quiver and breathe. They hold back the same energy that powers
nuclear bombs and it doesn’t let them sit still.. They twist and vibrate sextillions of times
a second. It is time to end our journey and return to… click What are you doing? click Stop it! click, click, click, click, click, click,
click…. The Smallest Place (?) We have reached the bottom, the border between
reality and unreality. The scale here is the Planck length, which
is the distance light travels in a Planck Time. Planck time is the time it takes light to
travel a Planck length. Ah ok. None of our models of the universe make sense
at scales smaller than this, so for now, this is it. Sad click :( We think that down here, particles bubble
into existence and then spontaneously disappear, creating a quantum foam of unimaginable energy. Can we go even smaller? We don’t know. It is time to return. If you look up, the universe is large and
strange. So incredibly large and strange. But if you look down, into the tiny and extremely
tiny, the universe seems even larger, and even stranger. In the end, the perfect place might be where
you are right now – not too big, not too small."
I9hJ_Rux9y0,2022-09-06T13:59:36.000000,The Reason You're Alone,friends make life good they provide the scaffolding that makes it not just bearable but fun they give us a sense of meaning and purpose and are a source of security self-esteem and happiness almost nothing predicts how happy you will be as how connected you feel and a lack of social connection is associated with a number of diseases and a shorter life but maybe you have scrolled through your phone unsure who to call to go to a movie with to celebrate with or ask for comfort you may realize that you don't have enough friends and feel lonely and it's not just you disconnectedness and loneliness are widespread many people want more close friends but don't know how to get them surprisingly nowadays loneliness is highest among young people whose relationships were also hit especially hard by the global pandemic social distancing stopped teens and young adults from mingling in classrooms clubs or dorms millions of friendships may be lifelong friendships that might have blossomed will never exist with profound long-term consequences for our Collective happiness the good news is that it's not too late and there are lots of friends to be found we'll mix scientific information with actionable advice in this video but we can't address every individual situation people cultures and schedules are different if you suffer from chronic loneliness you can also watch the video we made about it okay as with all important things in life making friends is infuriatingly simple but not necessarily easy but it works through a few pretty straightforward mechanisms the most important thing about making friends people make friends with other people when they spend casual time together this is how our ancestors formed their relationships because humans lived in small close-nit communities in which options for making friends were limited so we just formed good relationships with the people who were around us this is why it's so easy to form new friendships in school and University Society locks you and your peers in a building for several years you share similar activities but more importantly similar schedules overlapping and fluctuating Social Circles form naturally giving you regular FaceTime and shared experiences with many different people time to find others with similar World Views or senses of humor proximity can be more important than similar interests one study found that in student dormitories the distance between rooms was the strongest fr ship predictor living closer together meant a higher chance of becoming friends another study showed that being physically present in a class A Lot without saying a word makes others more sympathetic to you so the most important principle of making friends is to regularly spend time with people in the real world this alone can make it happen automatically and trumps all other advice but don't forget that making friends is not a numbers game or a competition don't compare yourself to others everyone has a social calibrator that can change as you go through life maybe you were more introverted as a teen but yearn for Connection in your 20s maybe you were part of sprawling Social Circles but prefer fewer friends in your 30s there is no right or wrong only right for you why we don't have enough friends the main reason for a lack of friendships is the simple fact that most people don't prioritize friendships nearly enough they don't realize until it's too late that retaining friend ships demands regular energy and attention although they are so important for happiness friends often take a backseat to other life decisions work commuting romance or kids take up so much time and energy that it's so much easier to crash on your couch and lose yourself in mindless activities especially as an adult going for a bike ride getting dinner or visiting a hobby store takes much more mental effort and commitment that it did after school when time ran slower and energy and curiosity were abundant but it's not just adults who are too busy for friends the average American Teenager spends more time on Tik Tok every day than socializing at parties events or on the phone with friends combined established friendships don't require the same time investment as early friendships to keep up but they do require some commitment as life distracts you it's easy to skip out on checking in when a friend goes through exciting or depressing times and so many friendships fade for lack of attention Often by accident which is extra tragic because there is never only one person losing a friend it's always at least two another thing that makes many people vulnerable is the way friendship networks are structured the Friendship Paradox is the phenomenon that on average most people have fewer friends than their friends which makes sense since you're more likely to be friends with someone who has many friends than with someone who has few rather than being densely interconnected friend networks are often built around central hubs so if central people disappear from your life this can deprive you of many connections at once and it can lead to a distorted self- perception that you are less popular than others although you are perfectly average it can get worse quickly with big life Events maybe you move for school work or love and are left without social networks or you had a breakup that left you with the smaller part of the formerly shared social pie the reasons why you find yourself with less connection than you want are as diver versus people but the underlying cause is almost always time there is no shortcut to make new friends and retain friendships you have to prioritize relationships spend time with people in real life and make them feel that you care so take a look at yourself and rebalance what you spend your life doing how to make new friends Studies have shown that new friendships can develop quite quickly weeks after you meet someone but it takes a few months for a casual friendship to become a close relationship with the biggest impediment being time invested and the quality of your interactions to make friends it helps if you intentionally look for people you have things in common with and who are open to new relationships you want to make it easy for yourself so examine what kind of person you are generally speaking extroverts tend to Crave sensory stimulation spicier Foods loud music or the excitement of engaging a crowd introverts often confused with shy people tend to be more sensitive to sensory stimulants and prefer quieter surroundings fewer people and even less spicy food different places attract different people not everybody can easily make friends at a bar or a football game not everybody finds a stroll through a park or a bookstore stimulating men especially form friendships around shared activities but in general it's a good idea to go to places that feel comfortable where there are people you might like who do things you find interesting look for local clubs or opportunities to volunteer check out what hobby stores are around and dust off your Space Marines or see if there are new D and D groups in your city and ask if you could join one check Meetup apps for gaming nights or wine tasting join a sports club or look for people who go hiking or want to cook together another obvious Avenue is your professional life it helps if you work in a job that attracts people like you so you might consider this when you choose a career deepening your relationship with colleagues can lead to Great friendships especially if you look for peers and there is is no power IM balance and of course there are friends you've lost touch with you may be able to revive some of these relationships in some cases all it needs is a call or an invitation research shows that more often than not the other person will appreciate that you've reached out there are likely way more opportunities to spend time with others than you are aware of and if there aren't you can take the initiative and create them invitations are signals to start friendships so bring people together by having a dinner party organizing a football game after work or starting a board game group everybody appreciates people who organize fun things and the simple Act of reaching out can Kickstart a self-propelling upward spiral of well-being fun and connectedness that can seriously improve the life of everyone around you in meaningful ways if you meet someone you Vibe with it's pretty scary to make the first move but they may feel the same way equally interested in a friendship but also blocked by fear of rejection so it's wor worth going for it worst case they're not interested which will sting for a few hours but the best case could be a lifelong friendship a risk well worth the reward once you've formed early connections check in whether they have important things happening in their life of course it's important not to be overbearing but the more time you invest the more opportunity you have to engage in meaningful banter or silly jokes the fact that friendships take time also means that you need to be patient and kind with yourself especially if you're out of practice practice things will not improve overnight but slowly step by step if you keep up open up Care and Share many people don't have an issue being around others but struggle to turn acquaintances into friends so let's talk about two important principles that make it more likely that you'll connect caring and sharing in general our favorite topic is ourselves and the things we care about because we are literally at the center of our own universe so people tend to like people who are genuinely interested in them so if you want to make friends your goal should be trying to learn what makes them tick just as important as caring about others is reciprocity and openness to connect you need to share the experiences that made you you now you don't want to overwhelm the other person and immediately spill out your deepest Secrets but open up a little and reveal personal things because this also signals to others that it's okay to do the same the best case is that you find shared experiences maybe you both had a hard time in school maybe you share a passion for weird movies learning about others and sharing personal stories in a balanced way and not overdoing it is not an exact science noticing the line between opening up and oversharing requires practice and depends on the vibe of the conversation one of the perplexities of life is that to get something it can be helpful to convince yourself that you want it less than you do in general it's good to be laidback have fun and enjoy yourself do things for yourself without expectations but also be open to social opportunities and accept invitations if they show up and that's basically it give friendships more priority in your life check in with friends and regularly go to things to have fun show genuine interest in others and give them the opportunity to know you without selling yourself too heart if you do this you're on track if this sounds a bit scary the good news is that human brains are hardwired to seek connection It's Perfectly Normal to seek out new friends and there are many people who would welcome more close relationships there are friendships up for grabs everywhere and there are plenty of people who will be so happy to have you in their life as a good friend go get to know them we want to be part of your friendship Journey so we've created a few things you can share with new and old friends two Wormhole pin to connect you and your BFF no matter where you are if you want to share something with your entire friend group get a little bird pin for each of them they're all unique but fit together like pieces of a puzzle or get matching posters to let your friends know you're thinking of them or just browse all the sciency things we made for you if you like videos like this getting something from our shop is the best way to support us thank you for watching [Music]
W93XyXHI8Nw,2022-08-16T13:59:34.000000,Is Civilization on the Brink of Collapse?,"At its height, the Roman Empire was home to about 
30% of the world’s population, and in many ways   it was the pinnacle of human advancement. Its 
citizens enjoyed the benefits of central heating,   concrete, double glazing, 
banking, international trade,   and upward social mobility.
Rome became the first city in   history with one million inhabitants 
and was a center of technological,   legal, and economic progress. An empire impossible 
to topple, stable and rich and powerful. Until it wasn’t anymore. First slowly then 
suddenly, the most powerful civilization on earth   collapsed. By civilization, we mean a complex 
society where labor is specialized and social   classes emerge and which is ruled by institutions. 
Civilisations share a dominant mutual language and   culture and domesticate plants and 
animals to feed and sustain large cities,   where they often construct impressive monuments. Civilization lets us become efficient on large 
scales, collect vast amounts of knowledge,   and put human ingenuity and the natural resources 
of the world to work. Without civilization,   most people would never have been born. Which 
makes it a bit concerning that collapse is   the rule, not the exception. Virtually all 
civilizations end, on average after 340 years. Collapse is rarely nice for individuals. 
Their shared cultural identity is shattered as   institutions lose the power to organize people. 
Knowledge is lost, living standards fall, violence   increases and often the population declines. 
The civilization either completely disappears,   is absorbed by stronger neighbors 
or something new emerges,   sometimes with more primitive 
technology than before. If this is how it has been over 
the ages, what about us today?   Just as Europeans forgot how to build 
indoor plumbing and make cement,   will we lose our industrial technology, 
and with that our greatest achievements,   from one dollar pizza to smartphones or 
laser eye surgery? Will all this go away too? Today our cities stretch for thousands of 
square kilometers, we travel the skies,   our communication is instant. Industrial 
agriculture with engineered high yield plants,   efficient machinery and high potency fertilizer 
feeds billions of people. Modern medicine gives   us the longest lifespan we’ve ever had, while 
Industrial technology gives us an unprecedented   level of comfort and abundance – even though 
we haven’t yet learned to attain them without   destroying our ecosphere. There are arguably 
still different civilizations around today that   compete and coexist with each other, but together 
they also form a singular, global civilization. But this modern, globalized civilization is even 
more vulnerable in some ways than past empires,   because we are much more deeply interconnected.   A collapse of the industrialized world literally 
means that the majority of people alive today   would perish since without industrial agriculture 
we would no longer be able to feed them. And there is an even greater 
risk: What if a collapse were so   deeply destructive that we were 
unable to re-industrialize again?   What if it ruined our chances of enjoying a 
flourishing future as a multiplanetary species? A global civilizational collapse 
could be an existential catastrophe:   something that ruins not just the 
lives of everyone alive today,   but all the future generations that could have 
come into being. All the knowledge we might have   discovered, the art we might have created, the 
joys we might have experienced, would be lost. So, how likely is all of this? Let’s start with some good news. While 
civilization collapses have happened regularly,   none have ever derailed the course of 
global civilization. Rome collapsed,   but the Aksumite Empire or the Teotihuacans 
and of course the Byzantine Empire, carried on. What about sudden population crashes? So far we have not seen a catastrophe 
that has killed much more than 10% of the   global population. No pandemic, 
no natural disaster, no war.   The last clear example of a rapid global 
population decrease was the Black Death,   a pandemic of the bubonic plague in the fourteenth 
century that spread across the Middle East and   Europe and killed a third of all Europeans 
and about 1/10th of the global population. If any event was going to cause the 
collapse of civilization, that should have   been it. But even the Black Death demonstrates 
humanity's resilience more than its fragility.   While the old societies were 
massively disrupted in the short term,   the intense loss of human lives and suffering 
did little to negatively impact European economic   and technological development in the long run. 
Population size recovered within 2 centuries,   and just 2 centuries later, the 
Industrial Revolution began. 
  History is full of incredible recoveries from 
horrible tragedies. Take the atomic bombing of   Hiroshima during World War 2. 140,000 people were 
killed and 90% of the city was at least partially   incinerated or reduced to rubble. But against all 
odds, they made a remarkable recovery! Hiroshima’s   population recovered within a decade, and today 
it is a thriving city of 1.2 million people. None of this made these horrible events any 
less horrible for those who lived through them.   But for us as a species, these 
signs of resilience are good news. Why Recovery is Likely Even in the Worst Case One thing that’s different from historic collapses 
is that humanity now has unprecedented destructive   power: Today’s nuclear arsenals are so powerful 
that an all-out global war could cause a nuclear   winter and billions of deaths. Our knowledge 
of our own biology and how to manipulate it   is getting so advanced that it is becoming 
possible to engineer viruses as contagious   as the coronavirus and as deadly 
as ebola. Increasingly the risk of   global pandemics is much higher than in the past.
So we may cause a collapse ourselves and it might   be much worse than the things nature has thrown 
at us, so far. But if, say 99% of the population   died, would global civilization collapse 
forever? Could we recover from such a tragedy? We have some reasons to be optimistic. 
Let’s start with food. There are 1 billion   agricultural workers today so, even if the 
global population fell to just 80 million,   it is virtually guaranteed that many 
survivors would know how to produce food.   And we don’t need to start at square one because 
we could still use modern high-yield crops.   Maize is 10 times bigger than its wild ancestor; 
ancient tomatoes were the size of today’s peas. After agriculture, the next step towards recovery   would be rebuilding industrial capacity, 
like power grids and automated manufacturing.   A huge problem is that our economies of scale make 
it impossible to just pick up where we left off.   Many of our high tech industries are 
only functional because of huge demand   and intensely interconnected supply 
chains across different continents.   Even if our infrastructure were left unharmed, we 
would make huge steps backwards technologically. But then again, we are thinking in larger time 
frames. Industrialization originally happened   12,000 years after the agricultural revolution. So 
if we need to start over after a massive collapse,   it shouldn’t be that hard to re-industrialize, 
at least on evolutionary timescales. There’s a hitch, though. The Industrial 
Revolution was fuelled, literally, by burning   easily-accessible coal and we are still very 
much reliant on it. If we use it all up today,   aside from making rapid climate change 
much worse, we could hinder our ability   to recover from a huge crisis. So we 
should stop using easy-to-access coal,   so it can serve as a civilization 
insurance in case something bad happens. Another thing that makes recovery likely is that 
we’d probably have most of the information we   need to rebuild civilization. We would certainly 
lose a lot of crucial institutional knowledge,   especially on hard drives that nobody could 
read or operate anymore. But a lot of the   technological, scientific, and cultural knowledge 
stored in the world's 2.6 million libraries,   would survive the catastrophe. The post-collapse 
survivors would know what used to be possible,   and they could reverse engineer some 
of the tools and machines they’d find. In conclusion, despite the bleak 
prospect of catastrophic threats,   natural or created by ourselves, 
there is reason for optimism:   humankind is remarkably resilient, and even in 
the case of a global civilizational collapse,   it seems likely that we would be able to recover 
– Even if many people were to perish or suffer   immense hardship. Even if we lost cultural 
and technological achievements in the process. But given the stakes, the risks are still 
unnervingly high. Nuclear war and dangerous   pandemics threaten the amazing global civilization 
we have built. Humanity is like a teenager,   speeding around blind corners, drunk, without 
a seat belt. The good news is that it is still   early enough to prepare for and to mitigate 
these risks. We just need to actually do it."
4u5I8GYB79Y,2022-07-26T13:58:55.000000,The Deadliest Virus on Earth,"In the 1970s thousands of Chickenheads rained 
from the sky in Europe, making foxes and other   wildlife confused and very happy. Why? They were 
filled with a vaccine to fight the deadliest   virus known to humanity – since the 1930s 
a rabies epidemic had been sweeping across   wildlife populations in Europe and humans wanted 
to finally get rid of the virus once and for all. Rabies is named after Lyssa, the 
ancient Greek spirit of mad rage,   and has been haunting us for at least 4000 
years. It can turn animals into angry beasts   and humans into zombies that fear water. But 
what makes Lyssa fascinating is not just how   bizarre and deadly its infection is, but also how 
incredibly good it is at avoiding our defenses. Viruses exist on the edge between life and death, 
hardly more than a few genetic instructions that   need living cells to multiply. The lyssavirus is 
simple even for a virus: It has only five genes,   that is the instructions for five proteins that 
let it solve complex problems: Infect a mammal,   avoid its immune system, travel to its brain, 
make more of itself and infect new hosts. Let's see what happens if you get infected. It all starts with a bite, most likely by a 
dog carrying millions of viruses in its saliva,   pushing them deep into the tissue. The goal is 
your nerve cells, your neurons. They are living   electrochemical wires, transferring signals 
throughout your body, and can stretch for up   to 1.5 meters, with their cellular machinery 
on one end and a terminal on the other. The terminal is where cells talk to each other, 
by passing chemicals that convey information.   Lyssa probably binds to the receptors 
that are crucial for this process   and slips inside the unsuspecting nerve cells. Inside, the virus has to solve a big problem. 
It needs to get to the cellular machinery to   take over the cell and make more viruses 
– and because neurons are pretty long,   this can be far away. There 
is a solution at hand though: Cells have microtubules spanning their 
insides that give them structural integrity.   But they also provide a track system 
for a specialized delivery system:   Dynein motors are actual motors that use energy 
and deliver packages. They are made from 50   different proteins, ten times more than the virus, 
and look like a little pair of shoes. Lyssa uses   one of its five proteins to hijack this amazing 
system and order it to head for the nucleus. What is the immune system doing to prevent 
all of that? Well, unfortunately not much. Usually when a virus attacks your civilian cells 
are crucial in activating your immune response.   They notice that they have been infected and 
release hundreds of thousands of a special family   of proteins: The interferons that, well, interfere 
with viruses. We’ll have to simplify a lot,   but in a nutshell, Interferons alert your 
immune system to make antivirus weapons.   But they do much more: they tell civilian 
cells to turn down their protein factories   for a while – which means that viruses 
can’t replicate efficiently anymore. And interferons tell your cells to become super 
transparent, which is important, because how   can your immune cells notice that your civilian 
cells are infected when viruses hide inside them? Your body solves this by creating display windows 
into their insides, called MHC class I molecules.   Cells constantly produce stuff to stay alive,   and to showcase to your immune cells what is 
going on inside them, they take random samples   of their products and put them into these 
tiny display windows to give a peek inside. Interferon tells your cells to make WAY more 
display windows and become super transparent.   If a cell is infected and forced to make virus 
parts, your immune cells will see these parts   in a window and order the infected cell to 
kill itself – and all the viruses trapped   within. This is one of the most powerful 
methods of wiping out a viral infection. Unfortunately Lyssa blocks your neurons 
from making interferons and stays basically   invisible to your immune system. In contrast 
to many other viruses, when it replicates,   it doesn’t kill its host, which 
would also trigger alarm systems.   Instead it stealthily jumps from neuron to 
neuron, very slowly making its way to your brain. This phase can take weeks to 
months and very rarely even years   and depends on a bunch of things, like if the bite 
was in your face or foot or how many viruses got   into your muscles. Lyssa is a patient monster. 
Until it reaches its goal: Your brainstem. Finally, the immune system catches 
on that something isn’t right   and reacts. It dispatches some of your most 
powerful antivirus cells, Killer T Cells,   to seek and kill infected cells and wipe out the 
enemy. In other viral infections this would be a   turning point, but in rabies the T cells are 
rushing towards their doom. Simple Lyssa with   its 5 proteins plays a uno reverse card, using 
the immune system’s ingenuity against itself. Your central nervous system is a very fragile 
part of your body and so the immune system has   to be very careful. A few haywire immune 
cells in your brain is a quick way to die.   So they aren’t free to enter your nervous 
system, they have to be be invited in   and can be kicked out. To protect themselves, your 
nerve cells can order T Cells to self-destruct,   if they think they are overreacting. And Lyssa 
figured out a way to make infected neurons express   this order. So as your powerful defense cells 
arrive – they are ordered to commit suicide. 
  Now the virus infiltrates the brain stem. Once 
this stage is reached you are going to die. How Lyssa Kills One of the most irritating things about 
the Lyssavirus is that we still don’t   know exactly how and why an infected person dies. Our usual idea of viruses causing 
damage is by multiplying rapidly,   killing their host cells once they have made 
enough copies, triggering a massive immune   reaction that also does a lot of damage. But 
this doesn’t seem to be what happens here.   Brain tissue of rabies patients shows 
minimal, sometimes non-existent damage.  Instead of murdering everything in sight, it 
is currently thought that lyssa wreaks havoc   by messing up the neuron communication inside your 
brain, so much so, that it can’t function anymore. It attacks the brain and leads to symptoms 
like confusion, aggression and paralysis.  Now the virus begins to leave. Still traveling 
through neurons, it migrates away from the brain   and heads for the salivary glands. This is 
remarkable, because after traveling in one   direction the virus reverses its course. After 
decades of study we don’t know how this works.   Lyssa ends up saturating your saliva 
ready for the irate mammal to bite another   and repeat the cycle. While this seems 
like the beginning of a Zombie outbreak,   luckily there are no known cases of a human 
biting another and spreading rabies this way. Now the end is near. You are rapidly developing 
encephalitis, a swelling of the brain with many   unpleasant neurological symptoms, from lethargy 
to paralysis. Slowly at first, and then suddenly,   organ after organ fails as you slip into a coma. 
There is no known effective therapy, barely anyone   has ever survived Lyssa once symptoms begin to 
show. It is by far the deadliest virus we know. Except, there is actually something 
that could save you – a vaccine.   Rabies was one of the first diseases 
humans developed a vaccine for.   As vaccines do, it prepares your immune system for 
a future attack, so it has the right weapons ready   in high numbers. The horrific tricks of simple 
Lyssa don’t work once you are vaccinated. And the   vaccine is special for another reason – because 
Lyssa is so slow in the first few weeks, it can   be given to you after you have been exposed. So 
you can still be vaccinated after you have been   bitten by an animal. Which is super important 
if you’ve had contact with a sick wild animal,   say a bat, because you often don’t 
even notice a bite from tiny teeth. Rabies is a monster. One that has followed 
our species around for thousands of years,   that our ancestors were terrified of and rightly 
so. It still kills around 60,000 people each year,   almost half of them children. We are far from 
eradicating this monster – It lurks in the   shadows, in forests and animals of all kinds, 
ready to return in greater numbers if we ever   forget how to keep it at bay, or if we continue 
the trend of being suspicious of vaccines. Let us hope that one day 
humanity slays this monster,   so it can become like most 
monsters: Part of our imagination."
LEENEFaVUzU,2022-06-28T14:00:23.000000,The Last Human – A Glimpse Into The Far Future,"The future of humanity seems insecure. 
Rapid climate change, political division,   our greed and failings make it hard to look at 
our species with a lot of optimism and so many   people think our end is in sight. But humans have 
always thought they lived in the end times. Every   generation assumes they’re important enough to 
witness the apocalypse and then life just goes on. This is a problem because it 
leads to short term thinking   and prevents us from creating the best world 
for ourselves and our descendents. What makes   this worse is that we may actually BE living at 
an extremely critical moment in human history.   To understand why, let us look at the 
temporal window of humanity and ask: When will the last human be born and 
how many people will there ever be? These sorts of estimates come with a 
lot of uncertainties, so please take   them with a gigantic grain of salt. To get 
a sense of how many people there will be,   let us see how many have already lived. Modern 
humans arose some 200 thousand years ago.   They were uniquely good at 
making tools, telling stories,   thinking abstractly, planning and working together 
in large groups beyond their close family. Still there were not that many of us. Surpluses 
in food were sparse, survival was hard,   life expectancy was low. It took us 150,000 
years to grow to a population of 2 million.   Improvements were gradual and eventually 
led to the agricultural revolution,   arguably the biggest change in our history. 
This was when our numbers really started   growing. It took ten thousand more years to get 
to 300 million. But that increase was dwarfed   by the industrial revolution. In 1800 there 
were a billion of us. The human population   doubled in just 120 years and then again in 
fifty. Today, we number around 8 billion. In total, over the last two hundred thousand years 
about 117 billion humans were born and lived,   and 109 billion also died. Which means that 
about 7% of all humans that ever lived are alive   right now. As many as were born in the first 
150,000 years of human history. Every minute,   270 babies join the party. But there are not just 
more people, never before have we been as healthy   and well off, or lived longer. With growing 
living standards our birth rates collapsed.   The UN estimates that around the year 2100 
we will hit our population peak and there   will be 125 million people born each year. 
It is pretty unlikely that birth rates will   stay stable forever, but let’s pretend 
to make our thought experiment simpler. How many people there will be in the future 
depends on when our species will die out.   And here we find a lot of uncertainties. 
We are able to destroy ourselves through   our own inventions – but we are also able to 
find solutions to avert catastrophic risk. We can change the direction of planet killer 
asteroids but we’ve also invented nuclear weapons.   We discovered antibiotics but also carry diseases 
across the globe in a matter of days. Our   industrial system gave us an incredible standard 
of living but also changed the atmosphere in the   process. It is very hard to say if human ingenuity 
will prolong or shorten our species’ lifespan. If things go badly our end could come 
suddenly. But if we manage to avoid that,   we could conceivably stick around for a long 
time. So every day we don’t destroy ourselves   may mean life for an unfathomable number of 
humans. How many people are we talking about?   It depends on how far our 
species is going to expand. Scenario 1: Humans will never leave Earth If we stay on our home planet, a good metric 
to look at is the extinction rate of animals   that we get from the fossil record. The 
average lifespan of mammalian species is   in the region of 1 million years, with 
some surviving up to 10 million years.   Our close relative homo erectus 
survived for about 1.9 million years. Let us be conservative and assume that humans 
will survive for a million years, which leaves   us 800,000 more years to dawdle away. Assuming a 
stable birth rate of 125 million people each year,   this means there are roughly 100 
TRILLION humans waiting to be born.   850 times greater than the number 
of people that have ever lived.   This would make everybody alive today only 
0.008% of all people that will ever live. Think about where this leaves you. Instead 
of putting you at the end of the chaotic   mess that was our past, it would mean you 
live at the very beginning of something big.   The start of the human story rather than the 
end. Doesn’t this feel incredibly different? And now consider that this may be 
an extremely pessimistic estimate.   If we match the survival time of the most 
successful mammals, then our future numbers   rise to 1.2 quadrillion people that have yet to be 
born. And even this seems far from our potential:   As the sun slowly gets hotter and brighter, earth 
will remain habitable for about 500 million years,   giving so many more potential people 
the chance to become actual people. And now let’s begin to think big. Scenario 2: Humans will leave Earth We went from humans worshipping 
the moon, to humans walking on it,   so who knows how much farther we can go? If we 
don't die out within the next few hundred years,   ideas that seem outlandish right 
now become serious considerations. If we believe that we have a chance of 
surviving for maybe millions of years,   then we could expand onto the other planets 
or into our own artificial worlds. Life needs   three things: a surface, resources and energy.   Our Sun provides energy for billions of years and 
there is so much water and material floating in   the asteroid and kuiper belt that we could 
sustain many times our current population. Instead of living on planets, we could decide to 
construct our own artificial worlds and habitats.   With resources and energy so abundant, we could 
try out different types of society and ways of   life. An interconnected civilization spanning the 
solar system would create the basis of existence   for an absurd number of individuals, orders of 
magnitude more than if we stick to earth, even   if it only existed for a few million years. This 
future doesn’t have to be grim and dark as science   fiction likes to paint it. With quadrillions of 
people waiting to be born, we will have billions   of doctors working on curing cancer, billions 
of problem solvers working on ending poverty and   billions of video game developers making life 
fun. More humans may actually mean more progress. Another upside of leaving earth and spreading 
out is that it becomes much harder for us to   become extinct, as you need a solar system 
wide catastrophe to catch everybody.   So aside from nearby supernovae 
or Gamma Rays bursts,   humanity would be relatively safe from 
extinction, maybe for billions of years. If we manage to survive for that long, slow 
evolution or genetic engineering might split us   into multiple species, or we might intentionally 
keep ourselves the same as we are now.   So to account for that, we’ll just talk 
about people from now on, instead of humans. Ok. Now let us think really big. Szenario 3: People leave the Solar System As enormous as the solar system is, it is just 
one star system among billions in the milky way.   If future people can colonize, say, 100 billion 
stars and live there for 10 billion years, while   each generating 100 million births per year, then 
we can expect something like a hundred Octillion   lives to be lived in the future. This is a 1 with 
29 zeros, a hundred thousand trillion, trillion. We can spin this up as much as we like. The 
Andromeda Galaxy will merge with the Milky way,   adding another trillion stars for us to settle. 
Red Dwarfs stay active for up to a trillion   years and future civilizations might even find 
energy for their habitats around black holes.   A sufficiently advanced civilization of our 
descendants might even try to reach other   galaxy groups. While these numbers are mind 
blowing, they may underestimate the number of   unborn people by many orders of magnitude. If we 
divide the total energy available in a galaxy by   the average energy needs of a single person, 
then we get a tredecillion potential lives.   A million, trillion, trillion, 
trillion potential people. Conclusion Hopefully what has become evident is that 
if we don’t kill ourselves in the next   few centuries or millennia, almost all humans 
that will ever exist, will live in the future.   Which brings us back to us, in the present. 
We exist at a highpoint of human history,   with incredible possibilities at our grasp. 
Technological, environmental and societal.   What we do matters for all the 
people who do not exist yet. So while it is not en vogue to think 
about humanity's long term future with   optimism – or to think about it at all –, 
maybe this has given you a bit of perspective.   If we screw up the present, so many 
people may never come to exist.   Quadrillions of unborn humans are at our mercy.
Even if we go with fairly conservative estimates,   the unborn are by far the largest group of people 
– and the most disenfranchised. Somebody who might   be born in a thousand or even a million years 
deeply depends on us today for their existence. This is why it is important to think about the 
distant future and why our presence is so crucial,   why it matters what we do today. One day the 
last human will be born. We don’t know when.   But if we change our perspective from 
us living at the end of the human story,   to us living at the very beginning we can 
not only build a wonderful world for us   and for them but also for 
countless numbers of others. HUGE announcement: we are launching Kurzgesagt in 
six more languages! Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese,   French, Hindi, Japanese and Korean, on top of our 
English, German and Spanish channels. To bring   new perspectives and a love for science to as

75d_29QWELk,2022-06-07T14:00:05.000000,Change Your Life – One Tiny Step at a Time,"If you are like most people, there is a gap 
between the person you are and the person you   wish to be. There are little things you think you 
should do and big things you ought to achieve. From working out regularly, eating healthily, 
learning a language, working on your novel,   reading more or simply actually doing 
your hobby instead of browsing reddit. But it sometimes seems that to achieve 
your goals, you have to become a different   person. Someone who is consistent, puts in 
more effort, has discipline and willpower.   Maybe you have tried your hardest to be like 
that. And it worked! For a while. Until you   find yourself slipping back into your old 
ways. In the end, you always seem to fail.   And with every failed attempt, you become more 
and more frustrated and annoyed with yourself. If you believe “success and hustle” 
internet, it is all your own fault:   if you don't succeed, you just didn’t want it 
enough and the failure is all you. But change   is actually hard. And as with most things in 
life, understanding why makes things easier. The Jungle Imagine your brain as a lush and 
dense jungle. Moving through it,   say to make a decision to do something, 
is like moving through an *actual* jungle:   It is hard and it costs energy. 
Your brain hates expending energy,   so it came up with a trick: All your actions and 
behaviors leave paths in the jungle of your brain. As you start doing something, you trample down 
some plants and make rough, improvised trails   through the undergrowth. The more often you do 
the thing, the more pronounced the trail becomes.   Over time it turns into a path that is 
easier to tread, so you take it more often   and it turns into a street. As you repeat 
doing the thing, over and over for years,   the street turns into a highway. Traversing it 
becomes effortless, familiar and comfortable. The more pronounced your brain highways, 
the more you get used to their comfort.   So we continue to use them, which means 
we tend to do what we have always done.   This is why change is hard, especially as an adult   when your jungle is criss-crossed by 
lots of established streets and highways. To understand how those highways are built 
we need to distinguish between two things:   Routines and habits. The Things You Do: Routines and Habits A routine is a sequence of actions that you carry 
out the same way every time because they’ve worked   out well for you. For example, you get the 
same ingredients for your favorite dish and   cook them in a certain order, because you like 
the taste of the result. Or before going to bed   you set an alarm at 6:30 because 
this is when you want to get up. Imagine routines executed by a wise planner. It is 
slow and analytical, responsible for strategizing   and mental calculations. The planner is 
aware of the future and carefully considers   what kind of result you want. Based on that, it 
chooses actions to achieve specific outcomes,   even if they are uncomfortable, like 
taking a shower after getting up. Routines can eventually turn into 
habits, which feel much easier   because they are basically a sequence of 
actions carried out without thinking about them.   You have done them so often before that 
your brain considers them rewarding   and a great response to a situation. So a 
habit can feel like you’re on autopilot.   You don’t have to convince yourself to do 
something that’s a habit - you just do it. The important thing about habits is 
that they are set in motion by triggers,   context cues that can be single 
things or entire situations,   that give your brain the signal 
to start the behavior or action. You already have a lot of triggers in 
your life: like when you see your phone,   you almost always unlock the screen. Or you reach 
for the seat belt when you sit in a car. Or when   you buy your coffee before work, you also get a 
cookie, even though you aren’t actually hungry. Habits are executed by an impulsive toddler. 
It responds to your immediate desires, based   on what is around you. Without considering 
any longer-term goals. For the toddler,   the future doesn’t exist and it hates hard work. 
So when it notices a trigger, it steers you to   take this easy road inside your brain that leads 
to a familiar rewarding result. If you get coffee,   the toddler also wants the cookie, just 
because that’s what you do every morning. ​This rewarding feeling is also how most of 
your bad habits started: chocolate is tasty,   browsing reddit is occasionally 
mildly entertaining.   This is why you repeat these actions, 
even if they are bad for you.   Rewarding feelings associated with an action 
demand to be repeated and so a bad habit is born. While the toddler sounds like 
a built-in sabotage mechanism,   it is as important as the wise planner and 
actually they work together most of the time! You need your wise planner for thinking big 
thoughts and parallel parking and doing your   taxes. But letting your wise planner do everything 
would cost too much energy. Outsourcing mundane   and repetitive tasks to habits, managed by 
the toddler, allows your brain to easily   manage your daily life, while dealing with more 
complex mental challenges at the same time. So if we want to change and introduce 
a new behavior into our lives,   we can actually use these energy 
saving mechanisms to make it easier. We will focus on small things, not big ones.   Improving your life a little is 
so much better than aiming high   and changing nothing. Especially because small 
changes can do a lot over months and years. How To Build a Habit If you want to make change easier, 
the best way may not be to force   it with willpower but to convince your 
brain that it’s not that big of a deal.   By creating new routines and then turning 
them into habits. You want your wise planner   to construct that first trail and then use your 
toddler to help initiate the action effortlessly. Let us say, you want to work out 
to be fitter, a very common goal.   The first thing to do is to break down this 
pretty vague goal into clear, separate actions,   because the idea is to make the action 
itself as easy a threshold as possible:   so small it is manageable and so specific 
that you don’t have to think about it a lot. For example, a tangible, 
controllable action might be   “doing ten squats” every morning. So you 
can start by trying to create a routine   but already include clear triggers 
that the toddler can pick up later on. Remember, a trigger is nothing more than a 
signal that you always associate with the action.   They can be visual pointers like seeing 
a particular object, like your training   outfit. Or a certain time of day, or a designated 
place like a nearby park – or even better, all of   these things combined. The important thing is that 
you always start doing your action in a specific   context. This trigger is the start button that 
will eventually set off the action automatically. So to establish a home workout habit with ten 
squats to begin with, you could make sure to   always do them with your exercise gear on, at the 
same place and time, like in your living room at   8am. Once you have your trigger and action, 
all you need to do is repeat them regularly,   ideally every day. If you keep going, they 
will change from a routine to a habit,   from a trail to a highway. Don’t get this wrong, 
the squats will still take you energy to do – but   the decision to do them will feel much less like 
a chore and more like a regular part of your day. While this is simple, it is not easy. Many things you want to turn into habits don’t 
offer as much instant gratification as wasting   time on reddit. To make your new action easier 
to repeat and more likely to be picked up by   the toddler, try to make it pleasurable. 
Not necessarily by rewarding yourself   after you did it, but by making the action 
or behavior itself more enjoyable. Like only   listening to your favorite podcast while 
working out, or chipping away at your taxes   while you wait for civilization to load the next 
round. You need to figure out what works for you. In principle, that's it. Frustratingly simple, like most things you can 
do to make your life better. How long it takes   for your toddler to take over and establish a 
habit varies widely. It depends on the behavior   you are trying to get used to, what kind of person 
you are, your stress levels and many more things.   It takes anything between 15 and 250 
days until a new habit is kicked off   automatically by its trigger. You won't 
know how long it will take for you. Starting is the easy part, 
especially in the first week or two.   Continuing to do it every day is the hard 
part. But it does get easier as you keep going. There are no silver bullets for 
change. But the science of habits   is a reminder that it is possible, 
no matter how old or young you are.   Even if you only end up doing a little more good 
stuff or a few new things, that’s still a success.   Being a little bit more healthy or knowledgable 
is a million times better than being unhappy about   a thing and changing nothing. In the end, 
change is a direction, not a destination. So now that we hopefully gave you a bit 
of insight and motivation, this is the   moment to sell you a thing! But please know, you 
do not need to buy anything to work on yourself. Having said that, we struggle with 
change as much as anyone else,   so we created our own habit journal, as much for 
ourselves as for you. Before we printed anything,   we tested it on ourselves and got 
feedback from the Kurzgesagt team. The idea is for you to track your habit 
progress for your desired behavior.   There is a tutorial part which guides you through 
the hardest part of the process step by step.   You’ll get helpful pointers, reflect on your 
progress and how you could make things easier for   yourself. Once you get through the tutorial part 
the habit journaling starts, regularly interwoven   by examples, science Breaks and reflections that 
will hopefully keep the journey interesting. Like our Gratitude Journal it is cloth-bound, 
with an embossed hardcover and printed on   high-quality paper. Nice to the touch and 
with lots of beautiful illustrations this   book is compangion on your personal change 
journey, however small or big it may be. Getting things from our shop is 
the best way to support Kurzgesagt   and what we try to do here on the 
channel. Thank you for watching."
Pj-h6MEgE7I,2022-05-17T13:59:44.000000,You Are Not Where You Think You Are,"Look around you. Where are you? Where is this 
place you are occupying? Somewhere in a room,   maybe in a city on a continent on a planet 
orbiting a star in a galaxy among billions.   But… where is all of that? While 
this may feel like a daft question,   it turns out that the concept of an absolute 
position is something humans made up. In a nutshell, the universe is a big 
bag of space that has things in it.   If someone removed all these things, the 
stars and planets and black holes and dust,   there would just be empty space left. 
In empty space, the concept of having   a position loses all meaning. Empty 
space is uniform, the same everywhere. The space we occupy is not like a stage under 
our feet. We can't mark specific points,   or staple something to spacetime as an 
anchor. Without things there is no position.   We are really ever only at a position 
in relation to something else.   Which also means that things we take for granted, 
like up and down are actually relative too. Ok, let us fill the universe up with things again   and try to find out where you are, 
right now. Relative to everything else. Let us start this video at a familiar place 
and then get increasingly weird. From your   perspective the world is seemingly flat and you 
can move in 3 dimensions. It's what physicists   call a 'frame of reference' - the perspective 
you have of the universe and how you see things   moving around you. Where your up and down 
is. Your frame of reference is correct.   For you – but not for the rest of the universe. Around 5 kilometers from you, where the horizon 
begins, the ground noticeably curves away from   you. If you could see through the ground, 
you’d see people from below or sideways.   But they don't fall 'down' off the planet 
because gravity doesn't actually pull them down.   'Down' is an illusion of your reference frame. To 
earth's reference frame, gravity just pulls in. But for humans there is an up and down because 
within our frame of reference that just makes   sense. Which is also why we think that the planet 
itself has an up and down, north and south. And   we made our maps accordingly. But an observer 
looking at the solar system might disagree.   Our maps make sense to us because we are 
used to them, not because they are correct. Ok. So this is step one – your position 
on what feels like a flat surface but   is actually a sphere. But this sphere is 
always moving, never staying in one position.   Earth is orbiting a star, the sun 
at the center of the solar system. While we usually imagine this as pretty orderly,   someone looking at us from the outside 
would see something pretty messy.   To see this more clearly we’ll exaggerate 
all these movements, this is not to scale. First of all, our orbit really is an ellipse, 
so we spend half the year sinking a little   bit closer to the sun speeding up, and half 
the year rising up a bit and slowing down.   And the ellipsis itself changes 
its shape every 100,000 years too. And in another cycle of 112,000 years, the 
ellipse itself is drifting – which at least   creates a beautiful shape. In the end, we 
get an orbital path that looks like a wobbly   circle with wavy edges. And it gets worse, as 
the moon now starts to screw things up too. As the moon is a pretty massive thing, it pulls on 
earth. Both objects orbit their common center of   gravity, that lies around 4700 km off to the 
side of Earth’s core. In practice this means   that as the moon orbits earth, it is jerking 
earth around a bit, enough to make it jiggle. Ok so you are standing on the 
surface of a rotating planet,   that is jiggling around the sun in an 
elliptical orbit that changes a bit every year. But who's to say the earth is right? From   the perspective of the sun the plane 
of the solar system is arbitrary,   it's defined as the plane the earth orbits in 
because that is convenient for us. In reality   the other planets are just a little 
bit inclined with respect to our plane.   From their point of view, we're the 
ones with a slightly bent orbit. But this is not it – far from it! The solar system 
as a whole is orbiting the center of the milky   way galaxy. If we look at the milky way, we can 
clearly make out a galactic plane in which the   solar system orbits the center every 230 million 
years. But of course it is not that simple. First of all, the plane of the solar system 
is not aligned with the plane of the galaxy.   Nothing really is – just like the planets in the 
solar system orbit the sun on their own planes, so   do all the stars orbiting the galactic center. The 
solar system as a whole is tilted about 60 degrees   towards the galactic plane, speeding through 
space at almost a million kilometers per hour. Someone in the center of the galaxy would see 
the orbits of the planets moving through space   in a helix shape, which you can 
imagine as a corkscrew motion,   on the tilted plane of the solar system, 
relative to the plane of the galaxy. This orientation in space means that sometimes the   planets are sort of in front of the sun 
as it orbits around the galactic core.   Let us just look at this for a moment 
– there is a strange and eerie beauty   abouthow our planets and the sun move through 
space. Do you feel a bit dizzy? It gets worse. This is still not the whole story because the 
mass of the galactic disk is constantly pulling on   the solar system too. Like a drunk dolphin, we're 
diving down and shooting up hundreds of lightyears   through the galactic plane, ten times every 
orbit, along arcs thousands of light years long.   We haven’t mapped this motion out 
completely, as it takes the solar   system tens of millions of years to go up and 
back once; and, well, humanity is not that old. Let’s look at your relative 
position again. On a planet,   tilted towards the sun, jiggled around by 
the moon. In a solar system tilted towards   the galactic plane, moving forward in a helical 
shape, diving up and down through the plane. Hm. But where is “up” in a galaxy? At this point 
the frame of reference becomes a bit arbitrary   and pointless because of the nature of the 
universe at this scale. The Milky way is   part of a galaxy group that appears to be part of 
greater structures like the Laniakea Supercluster,   which itself is part of the gigantic Pisces–Cetus 
Supercluster Complex and finally a galactic   filament that spans hundreds of millions of 
lightyears in all directions and orientations. Someone looking right at us from that far 
away will only see the End of Greatness.   All stuff appears homogeneous, the same 
everywhere. Just like with empty space,   when everything looks the same, who's to say 
anyone's view is better than anyone else's? We have reached the end of our 
little exercise in cosmic humility.   Let us make the journey backwards again. From 
the indescribably large, to the really large,   to our galactic home, to our galaxy, to the solar 
system diving up and down through the milky way,   to the jiggle of existence. And finally, 
back to you, right now, watching this video. If this is all a bit much, don’t feel bad. 
The scale of the universe is brain crushing   and trying to keep track of how everything is 
oriented or decide where the best up and down is,   is hard. But it doesn't really matter. 
Because it doesn't change where you are.   You're already in the best spot you could possibly 
be – right here, right now. For all you care   nothing can stop you from being right at 
the center of your own little universe."
7OPg-ksxZ4Y,2022-05-03T13:59:29.000000,The Most Horrible Parasite: Brain Eating Amoeba,"A war has been going on for billions of years 
that breeds well armed monsters, who struggle with   other monsters for survival. Having no particular 
interest in us, most of them are relatively   harmless, as our immune systems deal with 
their weapons easily. But there are exceptions. Naegleria fowleri is an amoeba 
that has not only developed a   deadly taste for human brains but is also a 
match for our defences and stars in dramatic   headlines. What happens when 
this monster enters your body? Naegleria fowleri is an amoeba, a microbe with a 
nucleus, one of the smallest lifeforms on earth.   It is a voracious hunter of bacteria and other 
critters that it devours whole and rips into   pieces. Like many amoebea it is able to transform 
into different stages that help it survive,   but most of the time Naegleria 
fowleri is in its trophozoite stage,   during which it looks like a squishy blob 
with tiny arms and hunts, divides and thrives. Its natural home is in fresh water: ponds, 
rivers, lakes and hot springs. But unfortunately   it also feels happy in pipes, swimming pools, 
fountains or spas when they are not properly   treated. The warmer the water, the more it thrives 
and multiplies. So in the summer, when humans seek   to cool off and enjoy themselves, the chances 
are highest that both species will interact. Because this makes it hard to avoid, millions of 
people regularly have contact with the amoeba,   especially in warmer climates, and many people 
even seem to have antibodies against it.   And this is mostly ok, you can even 
swallow it without consequences. Things turn bad when people dive or swim in water 
contaminated with the amoeba and water splashes   high up into their noses. In a single drop 
of lake water there are millions of viruses,   bacteria and amoebea and that isn’t really a big 
deal. But Naegleria fowleri is different. Let   us zoom into the nose of an unsuspecting victim 
enjoying a great summer day and see what happens. First of all, the amoeba doesn’t 
really want to be inside your nose   as it is not really looking for trouble, 
it just wants to eat a few bacteria.   Instead it is greeted by your natural defenses. 
Unfortunately for humans, Naegleria fowleri   happens to be exceptionally good at generally 
flying under the radar of your immune system.   For example, the inside of your nose is covered 
by mucosa, a slime filled with chemicals that   kill or stun possible invaders or alert immune 
cells. But Naegleria fowleri is not particularly   bothered by them and instead calmly checks out the 
scenery, mildly annoyed about the whole ordeal. Now, if you are unlucky, the tiny 
critter stumbles over something   that actually sparks its interest: Nerve cells. Your nose is filled with a large 
network of olfactory nerve cells   that pick up molecules from the outside and 
transmit their information to your olfactory bulb,   the center of smell in your brain. To do 
their job these cells talk to each other by   releasing various messenger chemicals and 
recognizing them via specific receptors.   One of the most important of 
these chemicals is acetylcholine. Through sheer evolutionary bad 
luck, Naegleria fowleri happens to   have receptors that recognize acetylcholine.   And it seems to attract them irresistibly, a 
little like moths that are attracted by light. So as your olfactory nerve cells do their job, 
using plenty of acetylcholine to talk to the   brain, Naegleria fowleri enters your tissue. It 
seems to follow the chemical signals upstream.   Neutrophils, crazy suicide warriors begin to 
attack the amoebae. Individually they have no   chance against them as the invaders are large and 
pretty buff fighters, used to dealing with tough   enemies. So the defenders swarm the intruders 
and kill them either by vomiting chemicals   that punch holes into them or by literally 
ripping parts of them off and devouring them.   But the Naegleria fowleri train is still on track 
and while the Neutrophil attacks slow them down,   they continue to follow the olfactory 
nerves to their final destination: Your brain. This process can take between one and nine days   and you’ll probably not notice 
anything during that time.   Until the amoebae reach the olfactory bulb, the 
center of smell and entrance to your brain. Your   brain cells are nothing more than helpless victims 
and they all release that wonderful acetylcholine. Naegleria fowleri initiates a massacre and 
releases an onslaught of various attack molecules.   Some of them are basically little bombs 
that rip holes into your cells on contact   so their pieces can be eagerly 
consumed. But Naegleria fowleri   is now multiplying - and it's also becoming 
really creepy. In a feeding frenzy it can   develop up to a dozen suckers called food cups, 
that look like giant eerie mouths. The amoebae   engage your brain cells, suck them in and 
rip large “bites” out of them while they   are still alive. Now things escalate quickly 
and the disease that will kill you sets in. Alerted by the massacre, millions 
of immune cells, Neutrophils,   Eosinophils and microglias invade the 
infected tissue. Which is a problem:   your immune system is dangerous and not 
exactly a careful fighter. It's like   burning down a forest to kill the wolves 
inside it. A really bad idea in the brain. They waste no time and attack the amoeba, 
using all the weapons available to them,   from chemicals to trying to eat them 
alive. Neutrophils explode themselves   to erect barriers spiked with deadly 
chemicals. A fierce battle ensues.   Naegleria fowleri can actually fight back, 
itself attacking and killing many immune cells. The immune system now throws everything it has at 
the invader but in vain. The complement system,   tiny protein bombs that can kill intruders on 
their own, are easily disabled. Antibodies,   usually one of your superweapons, are just 
destroyed or swallowed. A high fever that   usually slows enemies down does nothing, 
as the amoeba actually thrives in the heat.   All the while the amoebae continue to 
multiply, fight and devour your brain cells. A disastrous chain reaction is taking place.   One major thing your immune cells do when 
they fight is to cause inflammation. Which   directs large amounts of fluid from your 
bloodstream into the site of an infection.   So as the battle rages on without a clear 
winner, more and more fluid enters the brain. At this point the human will feel 
symptoms that quickly escalate.   It all begins pretty vaguely, a headache, fever,   nausea and vomiting. As the battle spreads 
rapidly through the brain serious symptoms appear,   from confusion, inability to concentrate 
to fatigue, seizures and hallucinations.   The brain swells up massively but can’t expand due 
to the bones surrounding it. So it compresses and   disables the brainstem that controls things like 
breathing. Usually within a week the patient dies. Up to 97% of patients infected by the 
amoeba share this fate. In almost all cases,   by the time an infection by Naegleria fowleri is 
recognized the disastrous battle for the brain   is already so far along that there is almost 
nothing to be done. Not only do we currently   not have effective treatments, there are also an 
abundance of open questions about how an amoeba   that usually enjoys its life in open water, is 
able to overcome our immune system so effectively. So how worried do you need to be about this 
horrifying killer amoeba? Well, not very. While   the Naegleria fowleri is clearly extremely deadly 
and the infection truly horrible, there have only   been a few hundred cases in the last few decades. 
You are way more likely to drown in a pool than   to get infected. Not only does the amoeba need 
to be flushed high up your nose, it also needs   to get a good grip and it also has to make its 
way through the first lines of your defences. Ultimately Naegleria fowleri is neither evil 
nor a huge public health risk. But every year   some unlucky people have to deal with it. We still 
have so much to learn about it and until we find a   way to treat it, Naegleria fowleri will continue 
to be this vague and horrifying thing, hunting   in puddles and lakes and sometimes pools. Usually 
for bacteria. And very occasionally, for people. - Oh hey, who are you? It is me, your existential dread! - Uhm, ok. I'm here to make you question your own 
existence and everything you hold dear in life! - Could you not please. Tooooooo late, just look at all these amazing

LxgMdjyw8uw,2022-04-05T13:59:18.000000,We WILL Fix Climate Change!,"our home is burning rapid climate change is destabilizing our world it seems our emissions will not fall quickly enough to avoid runaway warming and we may soon hit tipping points that will lead to the collapse of ecosystems and our civilization while scientists activists and much of the younger generation urge action it appears most politicians are not committed to doing anything meaningful while the fossil fuel industry still works actively against change it seems Humanity can't overcome its greed and obsession with short-term profit and personal gain to save itself and so for many the future looks grim and hopeless young people feel particularly anxious and depressed instead of looking ahead to a lifetime of opportunity they wonder if they will even have a future or if they should bring kids into this world it's an age of Doom and hopelessness and giving up seems the only sensible thing to do but that's not true you are not doomed humanity is not [Music] doomed despite the seriousness of the situation for years positive Trends have accumulated and there is finally some good news and a clear path towards our Collective climate goals Welcome to our Ted Talk please watch this video to the end check out our detailed sources afterwards to learn learn more okay let's start with the scariest things cancelling the apocalypse some of the most widely shared stories about climate change are that it is an existential threat the end of human civilization and maybe even our own Extinction event and that it's basically unavoidable now but what does science actually say as of 20122 the global average temperature has risen 1.2 de C compared to pre-industrial times limiting warming to 1.5° was the most ambitious goal of the Paris agreement but we are not likely to meet it already with the warming we have today hot places will get hotter wet places wetter and the risk and strength of extreme weather events increase significantly warming Beyond 2° makes all of these extremes more extreme extreme weather events more common with more ecosystems under major pressure some will not survive at 3° significant parts of Earth especially in developing countries might become unable to feed their populations heat waves will become a major Global issue large scale natural systems will break down the scale and frequency of hurricans fires and droughts will further increase and cause trillions in damage poor regions and subsistence farmers will be hit the hardest hundreds of millions of people will need to leave their homes in the 4 to 8° range the apocalypse begins the hot house Earth where things change so quickly that it may become unable to support our large human population and billions May perish leaving the rest on a hostile Alien Planet a decade ago for lack of action and perspective many scientists assumed a four plus degree world was our future and a lot of Public Communication focused on exactly this Future Path luckily it's much less likely that this version of the Apocalypse will come to pass if current climate policies stagnate we're likely to end up with warming of around 3° C by 2,100 which is scary and tragic and far from acceptable but this is actually good news how in the last decade we've seen enough progress that most scientists now think that we have likely avoided apocalyptic climate change although substantial risk Still Remains we can pretty confidently say that Humanity isn't going anywhere civilization might have to change but it will endure which begs the question what has changed over the last 10 years and is this really good news the invisible shift you probably know this story the last decade has been an immense failure for climate policies around the world instead of passing comprehensive binding bills that would meaningfully reduce emissions we mostly did nothing a loss decade with one negative record after another and this story is true as and it's one reason why so many people are giving up but it is not the whole picture despite the lack of climate policies and ongoing lobbying and misinformation campaigns from the fossil fuel Industries there was a lot of progress let's go back 20 years to see why today is so different between 2000 and 2010 greenhouse gas emissions had grown by 24% three times as much as the increase in the previous decade subsidies for fossil fuels aimed at promoting economic growth caused a colossal increase in their consumption for developing countries like China and India coal was the cheapest fuel for growth while rich countries showed little interest in changing their ways in 2010 many people expected these Trends to continue instead of decreasing fossil fuel use its consumption would rise the next decade turned out to be very different though first of all coal burning in developing countries like India has slowed down or leveled off like in China and it's plummeted in rich countries like the UK and us since 2015 34s of planned coal plants have been canceled and 44 countries have committed to stop building them 10 years ago that would have seemed like wishful thinking but today we can say with confidence coal is dying it's just not competitive anymore because Technologies we thought would remain expensive matured rapidly instead renewable electricity has shown explosive progress in a mere decade wind energy got three times cheaper solar electricity is now 10 times cheaper cheaper than coal or any other fossil fuel burning power plant despite the massive subsidies and Global infrastructure propping up fossil fuels 25 times more solar and nearly five times more wind electricity is produced today compared with 10 years ago which is of course not nearly enough one of the biggest obstacles is the variability of their power output renew need a lot of energy storage to be a reliable power source like expensive batteries amazingly battery prices have decreased by 97% in the past 30 years 60% in the last decade alone which will serve all kinds of Green Technology like electric cars you might say well that's great but didn't kot kazak's last climate video say that while wind and solar are nice we need nothing less than a fundamental transition of our Global industrial system yes but luckily the shift goes beyond just the energy sector throughout the economy people are working on improving current technology to lower emissions we're rapidly replacing old incandescent light bulbs with LEDs that are 10 times more efficient in 2020 about 7 out of 10 new cars in Norway were electric or hybrid in 2021 it was already eight out of 10 and the list goes on from electric heating and better insulation to ships traveling at half speed to save fuel wherever you look you find scientists engineers and entrepreneurs trying to solve some aspect of climate change enormous amounts of human Ingenuity are being brought to bear on this problem with more and more people deciding to prioritize preventing rapid climate change solutions for low carbon production of cement electronics and steel and Innovations like artificial meat and carbon capture are in the works the more of these Technologies we deploy the cheaper new and better technology gets the cheaper they get the more people use them and so on we can see the impact already the domestic CO2 output of rich countries is falling without a major recession since the year 2000 the EU as a whole shows a 21% decrease Italy 28% the UK 35% Denmark 43% but the best news may be that emissions are no longer necessarily coupled with the economic growth in the past this Was An Inconvenient Truth to get richer you had to emit more which led to Fierce arguments between developing and developed countries about the fairness of reducing emissions while their populations were still poor but in the last decade we've seen that it is possible to increase Prosperity without increasing emissions emissions in the Czech Republic dropped 13% while their GDP grew by 27% France reduced their CO2 emissions by 14% while increasing GDP by 15% Romania saw an 8% decrease and 35 5% growth and even the largest economy on Earth the USA decreased emissions by 4% while growing their GDP by 26% some of you may call this a numbers trick that rich countries are just exporting emissions to poorer Nations by moving the dirty parts of their economies like manufacturing but even when we account for all of our imported goods the numbers still look positive it's no longer a matter of having to choose between prosperity and the climate as it seemed to be a decade ago developing countries will profit from that because as rich countries pay for the expensive development of green technologies they can adopt them more cheaply they can skip most of the high emission phase that today's rich countries went through we are at the point where not decarbonizing is a bad business decision and we haven't even really talked about Solutions like carbon capture in 2000 it didn't really exist in 2022 that technology does exist and costs around $600 to remove one ton of CO2 from the atmosphere as investment pours in and the technology matures and begins to scale it's likely that these costs will plummet over the next few decades so everything's fine then well let's not get carried away all of these processes are great but not nearly fast enough we're still doing way too little and Technology will not magically solve everything we need to use fewer resources and use them longer design consumer goods that are repairable and durable and decrease our energy requirements we need much better infrastructure Agriculture and cities it will still be hard work especially to get the right policies passed and enacted but for the first time ever there are a few trend lines pointing solidly in the right direction and now imagine if all of this was achieved without proper financial and political support and despite fossil fuel lobbying just think what Humanity can do when climate change finally gets the political attention and funding it needs so is it okay to feel hopeful again the situation is still dire and serious so what's the point of focusing on this side of the story The Trap of hopelessness climate change can feel overwhelming and make your future seem Bleak the sadness and hopelessness that many people feel is real and very destructive because it causes apathy apathy that is only serving the fossil fuel industry that is still delaying change however it can in a sense they have weaponized hopelessness we are now in phase four in the public debate about rapid climate change action phase one was climate change is not real phase two was climate change is real but not caused by humans phase three was climate change may be caused by humans but it's not that bad phase four is climate change is no longer avoidable we are doomed and it doesn't matter what we do if we want the World to Change we first need to believe that change is possible and we have an abundance of evidence that it is changes to our industrial system are gaining momentum technology gets better and cheaper climate change has become a key issue in most free elections as more and more younger people move into influential positions they prioritize climate change and work on new Solutions in 2022 most governments not only acknowledge it but set their own Net Zero goals in Democratic and autocratic countries the results of years of fighting a steep uphill battle are now clearly visible the pressure needs to keep increasing to make sure that the promises made today are actually kept climate doomeris is the equivalent of giving up even though you can still prevent not just the worst case but also mitigate most of the bad things make changes in time to adapt better and prevent the poorest from suffering that is why hopelessness and apathy are so dangerous if the last in any ways wasted decade has shown anything then it's that progress is being made and that dire scenarios are just predictions not our sealed fate as of 2022 based on current Global policies we will end up in a 3° world now it's our job to yet again prove the predictions wrong despite how serious and urgent things are to turn that 3° into a two de and then see where we can go from there for that we need hope and we hope we gave you that today at least a little that you feel that things are serious but also that you have a future that you could have kids without dooming them or the world that taking action today is worth it and that despite powerful Industries doing everything to delay it Society is changing if you need a more concrete road map of what you can do personally we're working on a follow-up video to talk about that in Greater detail weaponized hopelessness are the only Trump cards left for the powers that don't want change don't let them win [Music]"
KRvv0QdruMQ,2022-03-01T14:59:23.000000,Are There Lost Alien Civilizations in Our Past?,"When we think about alien civilizations we 
tend to look into the vastness of space,   to far away planets. But there is another   incredibly vast dimension that we might 
be giving too little thought to: time. Could it be that over the last 
hundreds of millions of years,   other civilizations existed on earth? 
Indigenous technological species that   rose and died out? And that they or 
their artifacts are buried beneath   our feet? What does science have to say about 
this and what are the implications for us? Life on earth has existed for 4 billion 
years, mostly as single celled organisms   until some 540 million years ago the Cambrian 
explosion heralded the age of animals. A huge   time window for our indigenous aliens. Where would 
we look for them and what could we hope to find?   Sadly we have only one 
civilization to look at: Ourselves. Anatomically modern humans emerged around 
300,000 years ago and probably lived in small   groups of hunter gatherers, slowly spreading 
around the world. Progress was slow and our   lifestyle did not change much, although there 
may have been local bursts of complexity. Until about 10,000 years ago, when 
the agricultural revolution changed   our lifestyle forever, enabling massive 
population growth and technological progress.   Rather than just animals with culture and tools 
that would have been invisible from space,   we changed the face of the 
planet, cleared forests and   constructed cities and temples for our 
gods at breathtaking speeds and scales. Until about 300 years ago, we became 
an industrial species and yet again   our numbers grew exponentially 
as did our impact on the planet. We could say that our 300,000 year 
long history has three phases:   We were hunter gatherers for 97%, farmers for 
2.9% and industrialists for 0.1% of our history. And yet we are super new on earth.   On geological timescales, even the sturdiest 
things lose their durability. The oldest large   scale surface is in the Negev Desert, a meager 
1.8 million years old. Everything older has been   crushed to dust or turned over and it is either 
below the ground, or covered by ice or ocean.   Our age, the Anthropocene will be a layer only 
a few centimeters thick in a few million years. If there were aliens before us and they 
too went through these three phases,   what would remain of them? What can we learn 
about indegnous aliens by looking at ourselves? Hunter & Gatherer Aliens We actually know that in the last few million 
years, there were hunter gatherers aliens.   Our ancestors like Homo Erectus and cousins like 
the Neanderthals or Denisovans and probably many   more that we haven’t found yet or are lost to 
time forever. They left fragments of their bodies,   of weapons and tools and even art. Considering how 
long they existed and how little remains of them,   although they lived not that far from our present 
it is easy to think there have been others. Intelligent animals like us that could talk and 
use tools and fire, that had culture and art. For   the last two million years, most hominins lived as 
hunter-gatherers – so if these aliens never moved   up higher on the tech tree, hundreds of different 
species and cultures could have existed without   leaving any traces. Their artifacts lost to 
biological and then geological processes.   At worst they would leave absolutely nothing 
to be found after thousands of years. But what about fossils? We talked about how 
unlikely the process of fossilization is in more   detail in our dinosaur video, but in a nutshell, 
per hundred thousand years of earth's history   we only get a handful of good fossils. So we might 
easily just miss fossils of such people – but even   if we had any, we would not necessarily be 
able to identify them as hunter gatherers. Agricultural and Empire Aliens Looking at humans again, agricultural societies 
left much more to be dug up and found,   because they used more sophisticated tools made 
from sturdier materials and had to feed millions,   leaving many more artifacts. Farming 
allowed them to specialize and develop tech   from writing to navigation, architecture 
and government. Over thousands of years city   states became kingdoms and empires, some 
existing for millennia before they fell. Many of the buildings or monuments 
they constructed are still around   and traces of them will exist for a few thousand 
more years. Some only as outlines in the ground,   but still recognizable to future archaeologists. 
The pyramids are piles of limestone so massive   that they will probably be around for hundreds 
of thousands of years. And because of the   greater numbers of humans that lived during our 
farm and empire period, we can expect way more   fossils and artifacts to be detectable, maybe 
for a few million years before they vanish. So we can say with confidence that no such 
indigenous alien civilization existed in the   last few million years because otherwise we 
would have found something that they left. This still leaves a window of hundreds of millions 
of years, back to the emergence of complex life,   where we would not be able to tell. If there were 
alien pre industrial societies and empires on the   level of the ancient Romans or Chinese, they would 
have likely disappeared without a trace. Their   tools, even advanced metals, would have rotted 
away. If they dug up canals, cleared forests and   built cities, their traces would be very hard to 
distinguish from nature. Maybe there once was an   empire of cephalopods occupying impressive cities 
in swamps and lakes, made from wood and stone.   Their engineers flooding land to build wet cities, 
their poets reciting poems in a language of   colors. Maybe they never industrialized – maybe 
their society was too stable or not inventive   enough or they never got a chance. A single 
event like an asteroid, an epidemic or an ice age   could just have deleted their civilization, 
ground up their temples as their soft bodies   rotted away. Sadly we don’t have the tiniest 
amount of evidence for any such civilization. After a few million years at best, their 
achievements would have dissolved into nothing. Industrial Indigenous Aliens What about industrial civilizations, 
like humanity today? Imagine humans   died out suddenly, through a pandemic or cosmic 
rays or something like that. What would remain? Our impact on the planet is orders of 
magnitude greater than that of our ancestors.   The fossil record will show a 
great extinction of wildlife   and an explosion of fossils from human associated 
animals, like rats, cows, pigs and chickens.   Like the structures of our ancestors, skyscrapers 
and streets and harddrives will basically crumble   into nothingness in a few millennia. But 
because there were so many humans everywhere,   for a few million years after our sudden end, 
there would be clear hints of our existence. The byproducts of our industrial lifestyle might   actually give us away for some 
hundreds of millions of years . We use massive amounts of artificial fertilizer 
which redirects earth’s flow of nitrogen that   is being deposited in the soil. Mining metals 
and rare Earth elements leaves long term scars   and depletes natural resources. We saturate 
our oceans with plastics that find their way   to the ocean floor and may persist 
for hundreds of millions of years.   There are radioactive elements and their decay, 
unnatural accumulations of elements that do not   exist outside labs or weapons. And of course, in 
our short industrial history we have changed the   proportion of CO2 in the air by burning massive 
amounts of fossil fuels, increasing the acidity   of the oceans and so on. We may already 
have left a mark in the geological record. So far we have found no traces of 
an industrial alien civilization.   No layers of weird chemicals or displaced 
elements. No radioactive layer to indicate   that once great nations waged nuclear 
war. We do see mass extinctions and   massive shifts in the fossil records but no 
evidence that they did not occur naturally. And ironically we’ve hit upon an interesting 
problem here: If industrial societies stress the   ecosystem enough to cause their own extinction, 
they won’t be around that long. But if they become   sustainable their imprint on the geological record 
may be tiny. If past industrial civilizations were   sustainable before they died out, we may have 
little to no chance of ever knowing about them. In any case, over hundreds of millions 
of years these signatures may become   very subtle and get overlooked or interpreted as 
natural. Even if an industrialized alien society   existed 200 million years ago and lasted 
for 100,000 years, 300 times longer than   industrial humanity, it still might be 
easy to miss it in the geological record. In any case, all of this is speculation. In 
the end we should not use our imagination to   trick ourselves into thinking we know anything 
about our blind spots. Just assuming a thing   happened because we don’t have evidence 
against it is a trap we should avoid. So for now, if we look at the 
vastness of time it seems as   devoid of aliens as the vastness of space. Maybe 
we are alone in this universe and always were.   Maybe we’ll find traces of others eventually, we 
don’t know. But there is one important takeaway:   The continuation of our civilization is 
not guaranteed and if we are not careful,   we may disappear forever. Let’s 
hope that in a few million years,   there won't be another civilization 
studying our layer in the fossil record."
lheapd7bgLA,2022-02-08T14:59:49.000000,What Happens if the Moon Crashes into Earth?,"today we are answering an age-old very scientific and important question what if the moon crashes into Earth it's more interesting and weird than you probably think let's start with the basics why isn't the moon on its way to crash into us [Music] already we know that Earth's gravity pulls everything towards it including the moon but somehow it stays up as if suspended by some opposite Force but there is no other Force countering gravity instead the trick to staying up is a sideways motion that we call an orbit you see orbits every day when you throw a ball it makes a tiny little orbit the only difference between the ball's orbit and the moon's is that the ball eventually hits the ground basically the reason is speed if you could throw your ball fast enough it would bend around the the world and come back to you if there were no air slowing it down it could orbit forever and this is what the moon does falling sideways around Earth very fast with no air slowing it down orbiting Earth every 27 days at 3,600 km an hour so for the moon to just stop in its orbit and plummet to the Earth would break more laws of physics than we have time to explain so how do we crash it into Earth in a nutshell to change an object's or it you need to change its speed which changes where gravity takes it but even small changes require enormous forces which is why all the large objects in the solar system are so stable nowadays according to science the moon is big and very massive even igniting billions of Rocket engines all over its surface would barely move the Moon it looks like nothing short of magic will make the moon fall so we'll use a magic spell that slows down the moon so much that it changes its orbit and spirals towards Earth to get the most from the experience the moon will take exactly 1 year before it hits Earth ready 3 2 1 magic month one for the first few days nothing really changes the moon gets a tiny bit brighter and scientists get confused but the rest of us don't notice anything different the only noticeable real effect of the moon on the Earth are the tides Tides exist because while Earth pulls on the moon the moon's gravity pulls back on the earth since the strength of gravity gets weaker with distance different parts of the earth feel a slightly different pull which causes the Earth especially the oceans to bulge when the moon is above them and contract a little on the sides when it's not as Earth rotates every day underneath the moon the moon's influence fluctuat causing the water level of the oceans to Rise and Fall by about half a meter twice a day but with the moon drawing ever closer high tide gets higher every day at first barely noticeable within a month the moon has covered half the distance to the Earth and ocean tides have grown to 4 M every day high tide comes and waves flood coastal cities and there's no end in sight with the moon drawing ever closer Tides rise ever higher inundating another city and more inhabited land with salty water every day month two by the end of month 2 the moon has covered 2/3 of the distance to Earth and Global infrastructure is crumbling as Tides rise above 10 m displacing up to a billion people who happen to live near the coastlines as ports become inoperable shipping grinds to a halt not only will it slow down the delivery of quazar products but also less exciting things like food Global Communications fall into disarray 95% of the internet is carried by ocean Crossing cables and while these largely don't mind the water their terminals on land do living in land doesn't guarantee safety either tidal boards cause rivers to flow backwards carrying salt water to contaminate surface and groundwater supplies gas shortages follow as all refineries near the coast are abandoned countries are left with the supplies they had on their shelves and strict rationing will begin in the cities chaos rains during the Scavenging hours of low tide while survivors take refuge in highrises when the water returns month three 3 months in and the Moon is close enough to disrupt communication and navigation satellites while it's normally far too distant for its gravity to cause any major problems for our satellites The Closer it gets the more warped their orbits become as their fuel for orbital Corrections Runs Out satellites coren out of control months four and five on Earth the tides are rapidly growing to about 30 m and will be reaching 100 m in height in a few short weeks at low tide the ocean recedes hundreds of kilometers exposing the continental shelf like vast deserts while at high tide walls of water drown agriculture houses and skyscrapers and now almost 5 months in the apocalypse has finished its warmup act since the oceans are on average only 3 km deep the tides have reached their maximum up until now the water in the oceans could flow absorbing most of the moon's gravitational squeezing but now the Earth itself is ready feeling the squeeze of the ever approaching Moon these aren't so much tides of water but tides of rock the squeezing of the planet combined with the weight of quenti of tons of water sloshing on and off the tectonic plate creates enormous stresses below and begins to cause earthquakes of increasing magnitude and intensity it's impossible ble to say how serious these earthquakes might be or where they occur but like a child jumping on their bed Until It Breaks no good can come of it strong tidal forces lead to volcanism on other planets and moons on Earth squeezing the planet disrupts the magma reservoirs inside the crust triggering sizable climate altering eruptions in Chile New Zealand Yellowstone and elsewhere meanwhile watching patiently above is the moon still no bigger in the sky than a small Cloud within 75,000 km of Earth it is bright enough to illuminate the night sky like Twilight months 6 and 7 after half a year the Moon is entering the space once occupied by geosynchronous satellites where it orbits Earth every 24 hours it appears to float at one spot in the sky unmoving cycling through a full set of phases every day but only visible to half the planet with the moon stationary above the Earth the tide it seemed to freeze in place half the world flooded half with its water seemingly returned to the Sea as if Earth is holding its breath to prepare for the worst as the moon sinks further you might wonder if its gravity would overpower Earths pulling you up and ending your misery fortunately not the Earth's surface gravity is about six times stronger than the moon so even if the moon were hovering right on top of you you would still stay on the ground on the moon things are different though the near Side of the Moon is more strongly affected by Earth's gravity so during the next few months it starts to stretch forward towards the earth into something of an egg triggering deep moonquakes as the lunar Rock flexes and changes shape though barely noticeable now this squish will grow to hundreds of kilometers in a matter of months Months 8 to 11 at this point the apocalypse has arrived and we can summarize the months before the crash as everybody left has a bad time the tides sweeping over the Earth slow down and then reverse their Direction because the moon now orbits Earth faster than it rotates the planet will experience an abundance of earthquakes and volcanism massive amounts of volcanic Aerosoles rise High into the stratosphere shiny enough to reflect sunlight back into space what little light gets through is rust red and is periodically diminished by daily eclipses the result is a rapid global cooling with acid rains and summer snows killing even the hardest plants the clock runs out on civilization billions have perished while an x-shaped moon is still drawing closer let's get ready for the grand finale month 12 finally at the end of the year the moon has reached the rash limit that's the point where Earth's gravitational pull on the moon is stronger than the moon's own gravity things on the lunar surface start falling towards Earth and and by the time it crosses 10,000 km the entire Moon disintegrates into Rubble smearing itself into a massive ring system around the earth fortunately the moon's disintegration means the misery on Earth has ended no moon means the general apocalyptic nature of things comes to a halt the oceans recede flowing off the land one last time any survivors are treated to a view of tremendous arches spanning the sky glimmering in the Sun light Illuminating the night sky more brilliantly than any full moon ever could while meteor showers of moond dust fill the sky it's hard to say what happens next but the Tranquility may be shortlived if too much moond dust rains down friction heats the atmosphere possibly boiling the oceans if not the enormous Shadows cast by the Rings combined with all the volcanic and meteoric aerosols block even more sunlight and a period of runaway cooling could begin the freezes much of earth's surface solid in any case at some point people will emerge again from submarines or bunkers or mountaintops they will not have a great time before rebuilding civilization and their success is not guaranteed but at least they'll be trying to do so with beautiful rings in the sky"
xAUJYP8tnRE,2021-12-14T15:00:03.000000,Why We Should NOT Look For Aliens - The Dark Forest,"The Universe is incredibly big and seems full
of potential for life, with billions of habitable planets. If an advanced civilization had the technology
to travel between the stars, at just 0.1% of the speed of light, It could colonize our
galaxy in roughly 100 million years. Which is not that long given the billions
of years the milky way has existed – so in principle any spacefaring civilization
should be able to spread rapidly over huge sectors of the galaxy. And yet we see nothing, hear nothing, the
universe seems empty. Devoid of others. This is the Fermi Paradox, which we have discussed
in more detail in other videos. Confronted with the seemingly empty universe,
humanity faces a dilemma. We desperately want to know if we are alone
in the Milky Way. We want to call out and reveal ourselves to
anyone watching but that could be the last thing we ever do. Because maybe the universe is not empty. Maybe it’s full of civilizations but they
are hiding from each other. Maybe the civilizations that attracted attention
in the past were wiped away by invisible arrows. This is the Dark Forest solution to the Fermi
paradox. The Way Of Life The hunter awakes in his hiding place and
carefully listens for suspicious noises from the thick undergrowth before he gets up. Another night has passed without incident. The forest is dark and full of fog. He considers calling out to others to end
his loneliness but stops himself at the last moment. What if they are like him? All living things seek to survive, secure
resources and multiply. Their greatest obstacle are other living things
that share the same objective. Competition between species favored the survival
of beings with advantageous traits. Our ancestors were inventive, competitive,
expansionist and greedy for resources, which led to them winning the competition for our
planet. Today, most other animals are so utterly at
our mercy that we wipe out about a dozen species a day, just as an unintentional byproduct
of how we like to run things. But humans are more than individuals. From us cultures emerge, that also compete
with each other. Competitive and expansionary cultures spread
faster and further and merge with, subdue or destroy others. If we look at our history it becomes clear:
We are dangerous. Not just to others but also to ourselves. Our human nature has driven us to take over
every corner of our planet and soon we will look to the stars, both to expand our domain
and ensure access to ever more resources. And then we might stumble upon others trying
to do the same thing. It is likely that the competition of life
also takes place on far away planets, so it is logical to assume that an alien civilization
that came to dominate their planet would be in some regards similar to us. But if they are similar to us, they, too,
may be dangerous. The Implication As the hunter sneaks through the dark forest
all alone he knows that there might be others like him. He can’t know their intentions, if they
are aggressive or not. The hunter knows he would kill to ensure his
own survival, so he has to assume that they would too. And it might be that if he stumbles upon another
hunter, the one that shoots first survives. None of this means that conflict is unavoidable. So far the progress of the modern world seems
to have made us more peaceful, not more violent. Maybe this is true for other civilizations
too, that eventually progress means less conflict, not more. Different alien civilizations also should
vary from the mild and peaceful to the malevolent and militaristic. The existential problem we are facing is that
when we meet others between the stars, we have no way of telling who is peaceful or
aggressive and what their true intentions are. Similarly, they might not understand or trust
our intentions even if we tell them that we are peaceful. On top of that, if we did discover another
civilization, and they discovered us, the light years between us would mean years of
communication delay. Both sides would be in a state of uncertainty,
wondering if the wisest move is to just attack, because there's another serious issue: technological
explosions and first strike advantage. We do not know where the limits of technology
are, but we do know how much technological progress matters in war. A few hundred or thousand years can turn conflict
with uncertain results into a one sided massacre. Caesar's legions would stand no chance against
Napoleon's army with their cannons and muskets. Which would be eradicated by artillery from
the first world war. Which would not stand a chance against today's
drones and guided missiles. So the power level of different civilizations
may vary massively and even if not, between the time it takes us to detect another civilization
and us saying “hi” we might already be hopelessly behind on the tech tree. Which is bad enough, but the nature of interstellar
conflict makes this worse. If your opponent is light years away, sending
an invasion fleet takes so long that by the time it arrives it might be hopelessly obsolete. So, war between civilizations might be just
about eliminating the other to remove an existential threat to yourself. Someone else who might be so scared of you
that they attack the first chance they get. In this environment, the only way to guarantee
a win is to strike with such force and speed that the target has no chance of survival
or time to counter-attack or escape to seek revenge later. The stakes are the highest possible with no
room for error. If we assume that the majority of civilizations
live on planets that leaves them pretty vulnerable – all you need to do is throw something
massive at a planet to make it uninhabitable. So the ultimate interplanetary annihilation
weapon is probably something like a Relativistic Kill Vehicle – a missile shot at a planet
at a significant fraction of the speed of light. For example, a missile the size of a person
going 95% the speed of light has as much energy as all nuclear bombs on earth. If you shot a few dozen at the civilization
you wanted to wipe out, success would be fairly certain – even a single hit would suffice. This is not that absurd of an idea – a civilization
only slightly above us on the Kardashev scale would have enough energy to send multiple
strikes against every planet it suspects of harboring life. What makes these weapons so sinister is how
much they favor a first strike, since they would be so fast that it might be impossible
to protect yourself effectively against them once they’re launched. Conflict between civilizations may not be
lengthy affairs but rapid winner takes all situations, where the first one to shoot wins. This makes any civilization an existential
threat to any other. And if every civilization is an existential
threat to every other, there may be only two kinds of civilizations out there: quiet ones
and dead ones. So what should we do? So, should we worry? It is unlikely that anybody has noticed humanity
yet. The radio signals we’ve transmitted in the
last 100 years traveled a relatively tiny distance and have long decayed into unreadable
noise. At our technological stage, if we don’t
actively try to get noticed and if nobody specifically looks at our pretty unremarkable
solar system, we’ll stay hidden. But one day we will venture into space in
a serious way and need to consider these kinds of questions again. We don’t know if there are others or if
we are going through the forest alone. But we have no way of knowing for sure. For the time being, it seems the best we can
do is to carefully listen. And even if we see others step into a clearing
and make themselves known, we should not reply right away but carefully watch them from the
undergrowth. Perhaps we are also thinking about this all
wrong by allowing our primitive brain, that evolved in the context of the gruesome competition
of life, to conjure fears of predatory aliens all around us. Maybe the fact that we are looking at the
universe like this is a sign that we are not grown up yet as a species. There could be a friendly, welcoming community
of alien civilizations waiting to hear from us when we are ready. As for now, the good news is there is actually
little we need to do. We just need to be thoughtful about the signals
we send out into the galaxy, we need to watch the sky and learn more about our galaxy, our
forest. Because whatever the nature of our forest
is, full of dangers or friends, or nobody at all, only careful observation can tell. So let’s do that. At last the hunter reaches a clearing and
finds a comfortable position. Slowly the sun melts the fog away, lost in
thought he admires the vegetation until suddenly – he is eye to eye with another hunter,
frozen in terror just like himself. His mind is racing, considering all the different
options. The hunter takes a deep breath and makes a
decision."
XFqn3uy238E,2021-12-07T14:59:44.000000,...And We'll Do it Again,qus gazar is lying to you in every video even in this one because our videos distill very complex subjects into flashy 10-minute pieces and unfortunately reality is well complicated the question of how we deal with that is Central to what we do on this channel and something we think about a lot [Music] what we mean by lying is the concept of lies to Children the idea that on the path to explaining something complicated you start off with a little lie a useful oversimplification that makes it easier to grasp a concept for example as a kid you learn that the Earth is a sphere orbiting the Sun with Planet bodies but it's not actually a sphere and the bodies are super different in size and not close to each other at all by beginning at a place of oversimplification your building a framework a foundation that you can then build upon and add nuance and complexity later on step by step you're getting towards the real gist of the complicated subject science communication has to use lies to children to some degree or it turns into Science Education and getting a proper education in all of the scientific Fields would take years of intense study to become fluent in them as a species we have a major interest in summarizing science and its advancements and educating as many people about it as possible because we all benefit if more people have a fact-based scientific worldview we will discuss what science is and how it works in different videos in more detail but for now let's just say it's a process to advance organize predict and test our knowledge about the universe if you understand the current state of scientific knowledge then you can make better decisions based on facts and testable ideas rather than outdated belief system or our intuition that evolved to protect our ancestors from Lions but is no longer suited for the complexity of our modern world our brains are comically ill prepared to navigate the fast moving world we happen to live in today a world ironically created by science a few hundred years ago it was possible to be knowledgeable at an expert level in pretty much every field of study in the information age this is a futile Endeavor since knowledge and data are increasing exponentially so to even have a chance of grasping the world we live in we need summaries that give us if not a true understanding of all the details a solid overview explaining science to many people is not about enlightening the ignorant but necessary for the progress of our species at large to make this possible we need to find metaphors and stories that capture the true nature of things as much as possible while using a language that our brains can deal with a great example here is physics quarks are often depicted as blue red and green with different spins but just saying Spin and using colors forces our brain to imagine colorful spinning balls which is great to visualize the different types and the relationships between quarks but also creates a very wrong image of reality in our heads molecules are nothing like the neat diagrams that we're taught in school but buzzing and vibrating entities held together by something we call charge that describes how certain things want to be close or Escape each other for some unknown reason we're describing phenomena that we are pretty sure exist in some form or another because the maths works out and we can do real world experiments and predict their results before we do them in reality these are models tricks to summarize what we know and make up a coherent story and prepare the ground for more in-depth explanations don't confuse the description of a thing for the thing itself simplifications like these are not just meant to dumb things down they're actually useful for experts themselves for example chemists who use wrong electron shell models to work out chemical bonds or scientists using simplified models as the basis for discussion with colleagues across different scientific Fields but the simplification of science can also be problematic for a bunch of reasons finding the true nature of reality is super hard because our brains did not evolve for this job and the universe doesn't care if we understand it science is a process to work towards gaining knowledge and not an absolute truth generator the answers it provides are multi-layered and nuance and that complexity can get lost when it's simplified especially when it's done so for headlines an interesting cancer study turns into a potential cure a healthy food becomes the basis for a new diet such simplifications give a misleading definiteness to science which goes against its process like nature when cures don't materialize and diets don't turn out to be magical we lose confidence in science and start to think of all science communication as misleading then there's the opposite effect if a simplification is too engaging if the story it tells is too good it can distort the true complexity of a subject and give you a full sense of security and an illusion of deep knowledge a gut feeling that you understand the science better than you actually do will which can lead people to ignore actual experts over their dangerous superficial knowledge and gut feeling and this can have negative consequences for all of us because in the worst case overconfidence in your own understanding of science can lead to bad decisions made with confidence just think of the surch of people that confidently disavow vaccines or climate change without truly understanding the subject matter so considering all of this and the fact that we at kots gazar reach Millions of people with our videos how do we handle this well it has been a journey especially the research when we started we just read articles then moved on to books peer reviewed papers then to conversations with experts we began to collect our sources with every step we realized that we were still not doing enough nowadays we try to read as many primary sources as possible talk to multiple experts and document our simplifications and give further reading in our sources dog but doesn't make our process Flawless what do you do if experts disagree with each other what do you do if you find an amazing fact that perfectly fits a narrative but just can't find its primary source how do you deal with the reality that many scientific results have huge error bars or mayis attached to them how do you handle complex systems that defy easy answers in the end we make 10-minute videos so we need to make decisions about what details and explanations can fit which aspects need to be simplified and which parts to cut there is no single best answer for how to do this and so we weigh the different options every single time it can be painful for experts to see their fields simplified some are happy with us while others don't like it this is fair but also impossible to avoid we're still trying to improve and want to be transparent about what we're trying to do for example we're taking part in the tresa project about science communication to learn more all of this brings us to the purpose of our videos the most important thing we want to do with this channel is to inspire you and Spark your curiosity for Science and the amazing Universe we live in learning often doesn't feel like fun but with the right story it is one of the best things and we hope to provide that to you ultimately we hope that we light a fire in you that motivates you to read books pay more attention at school or university and just get interested in a scientific field or two and learn more on your own not because you have to but because you want to know more about how the world really works because the universe is beautiful and science is a way of seeing this beauty more clearly and we hope that knowing that we have to simplify a bit does not make you enjoy our videos less we are trying to build something with kot kazak and while we're not 100% sure yet what exactly hopefully something that gets people to think about their own life and the context they exist in today as well as the far future and the potential we all have as a species and of course how big things are and what happens when we blow stuff up because it's fun thanks for watching and sharing and supporting us we really can't do this without you
F1Hq8eVOMHs,2021-11-30T15:01:34.000000,Is Meat Really that Bad?,"food is arguably the best thing about being alive no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old it's an expression of culture our parents love and a means of Celebration or Comfort that's why it hits a special nerve when we're told we should change what and how we eat to fight rapid climate change one of the most delicious foods meat gets the worst press it doesn't help that the topic is really hard to properly research yourself and that debates get emotional quickly but clearly science can give us an answer the reality is well it's complicated let's take a look at three climate arguments against meat that are used a lot and see what [Music] happens one does our diet really play that bigger role in climate change feeding billions of people is impossible without causing emissions even if someday we have zero carbon tractors refrigerators and cookers running on renewable energy and electric trucks to move our food there are still unavoidable emissions rice emits methane we cut down forests to make room for pastures and crops and we emit nitrous oxide when we use fertilizers and manure worldwide food production is responsible for about 26% of all human-made greenhouse gas emissions which is unfortunate since food is not optional while 26% doesn't sound that bad it means that even if we extinguished all other sources of emissions today the emissions from food alone would still use up our entire carbon budget by 2,100 so no matter how we twist and turn it food is a real driver of climate change still emissions from different food items vary a lot how do things look when we compare their Footprints separately food's climate impact is most often based on life cycle assessments an analysis that looks at all the emissions of a product throughout its existence from production to Transportation packaging use and waste management in the most detailed meta analysis of life cycle assessments to date beef emissions stand out at the top on average a kilogram of beef emits 71 kg of CO2 equivalent lamb is also high at 40 k pork emits 12 and poultry 10 kg at the bottom we have lots of plant-based Foods potatoes for example emit around 150 times less than beef the most important aspect of food isn't weight though it's nutrient density a kilogram of beef would keep you alive much longer than a kilogram of potatoes so how does the ranking change if we compare emissions per calorie or protein not much animal protein is still the most costly for the environment and beef and lamb are also outliers in emissions per calorie but is this Fair after all not all beef is the same there are all sorts of ways to rear cattle from Pure grass-fed to factory farming the worst beef comes in at 105 kg of emissions per 100 g of protein the best at only 9 a 10-fold difference in contrast most other Foods especially plant-based have a much narrower Spectrum still the best beef is worse than the worst plant okay but this seems promising can we buy the right beef and lower our emissions Maybe by buying locally produced beef to minimize our footprint two does buying local food actually matter let's stick with beef since it's such an outlier by buying locally you are trying to avoid emissions from transportation and packaging but it turns out these only account for 0.5 to 2% of beef's total emissions actually transport and packaging combined are only about 11% of all food emissions nearly all food transport emissions are produced over the last few miles the regional travel on the road supplying the markets and shops in your area International Food transport happens mostly on freight ships which are insanely efficient for example shipping 1 kg of avocados from South America to Europe generates about Z 0.3 kg of CO2 equivalent in transport emissions and around 2.5 kg overall while 1 kg of beef from your local butcher will come in at 18 kg in CO2 equivalence at least so even when shipped great distances emissions from almost all plant-based foods cause lower emissions than locally produced animal products okay so if transport doesn't play a big role what causes the vast amounts of emissions from beef then by far the largest share of beef emissions consists of methane released directly by The Animals while CO2 hangs around for centuries methane only stays in the atmosphere for decades but in these short periods it is very powerful all in all methane has already caused 23 to 40% of human-made warming so far there's controversy about how bad this is exactly and we don't want to Dive In Too Deep here but the way things stand any kind of extra emissions are not great still all cows burp and fart to similar degrees what explains the spectrum of beef emissions there are a couple of things it makes a difference if the beef comes from a dairy herd or one dedicated to beef production 44% of the world's beef comes from dairy cows sharing its footprint with dairy products dairy cows tend to get higher quality feed which makes them grow faster and emit less methane geography also plays a role because it determines which farming methods are possible the worst Factor by far is the destruction of forests for Farmland not only does this release the CO2 that was bound in the Flora it sets free Carbon that was stored in the soil and destroys its ability to store it in the future this aspect accounts for much of the range of emissions in beef the worst emitters are farms burning down rainforest for Farmland especially in Brazil there is a Sinister truth hidden here the more animals suffer the better they are in terms of climate change because they are way more efficient they use less land and their food is brought right to them and so they grow faster and don't expand energy on things like walking cattle in a factory farm that never get to roam pastures can sometimes be less destructive for the climate than cattle grazing peacefully on a formerly Lush piece of rainforest but isn't it a bit out of touch with reality to demonize cows so much some of the land these animals are grazing on isn't suitable for crops Anyway by grazing on pastures they can turn things we can't digest into food isn't farming animals just a smart way to make the best use of unused resources three don't cows mainly use land that we can't use for agriculture or other things about half of the world's ice and desert free land is used for agriculture an area the size of the entire Americas plus China half of all agriculturally used land is dedicated to animals most of it is grassland 65% of which cannot be converted to cropland so pasturing animals is actually a very efficient way to use those areas since we can't grow human food there anyway there are a couple of catches here though while the idea of cows turning useless grass into steak is nice it is part of a marketing lie even though it is so massive pasture land alone can't support the ruminant living on it globally grazing systems sustain only 133% of beef production so if we were to switch to 100% grass-fed we'd simply have to eat much less beef in the US beef production would crash by some 70% if it were to exclusively rely on grass the only way to sustain our high demand for meat is by growing crops and feeding them to our cattle and we haven't even talked about chicken and pig which exclusively eat feed crops because of this feed demand less than half of the world's cereals are used directly as human food 41% is fed to animals the same is true for soy there's a lot of talk about Amazon deforestation for soy production which makes us think of soy milk and tofu but only 19% of global soy production goes towards products for humans about 77% is used to feed animals besides land without food crops isn't automatically ecologically useless a beefree diet would free up around 2 billion hectares a vegan diet would free up around 3 billion hectares of land we could use this land to grow forests or restore wild grasslands basically anything that could suck carbon out of the atmosphere if we sped 3 billion hectares of land it could remove about 8 billion tons of CO2 from the air per year by comparison we emit about 50 billion tons of CO2 equivalent per year at the moment that means we could save 16% of emissions by eating a vegan diet okay to summarize food is a huge driver of emissions meat but especially beef is the worst food in terms of emissions buying locally does not have a big impact on food emissions compared to the type of food you're consuming when it comes to Beef Cattle that are grass-fed can sometimes even be counterproductive because they just need much more land even if you find the most environmentally friendly beef in the world your burger still comes with a significantly higher carbon footprint than a veggie patty you can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information"
LmpuerlbJu0,2021-11-02T14:59:43.000000,You Are Immune Against Every Disease,you're not a person you're a planet made of roughly 40 trillion cells there is so much of you that if your cells were humanized you'd be as big as 20 Mount Everest for your creepy cwy inhabitants this makes your body an ecosystem rich in resources and warmth and space a perfect place to move into and have a family while some of these guests are welcome most are not your immune system is the guardian of this planet the force tasked with protecting yourself against the constant danger of invasion unfortunately your enemies in the tiny world have a huge [Music] Advantage consider the effort it takes to make a single copy of yourself and your trillions of cells first you need to find someone who thinks you're cute date and be awkward and if things work out in a complicated dance two of your cells merge together then you need to wait for months while the cell multiplies over and over until it's released into the world as a human being and even then you only have a mini copy that needs years to become remotely useful a bacterium consists of one cell it can make a fully grown copy in about half an hour a virus can turn into 100 hundreds within hours and billions within days your enemies multiply orders of magnitude faster than you even worse for a bacterium or virus your body is a hostile ecosystem applying selective pressure because they go through so many generations so quickly eventually by pure chance there will be an individual that mutates and adapts in just the right way to resist your defenses and then multiply quickly again in other words you're facing a sheer endless variety of different enemies and you're too slow to keep up with their evolution this is bad luckily your immune system is just about the most amazing thing ever the second most complex biological system known to us after the human brain and so sophisticated that we still haven't discovered all its Secrets since it's so complicated we have to simplify and focus on one thing at a time if you want the full story wait for the announcement at the end of the video okay so why are we not all killed by some new bacteria or virus in a nutshell you actually have two immune systems the innate and the Adaptive immune system the innate immune system was ready when you were born it mostly consists of general purpose soldiers we introduced them in the last immune video the Adaptive immune system carries two types of cells t- cells and B cells that are your super weapons and are are incredibly effective and deadly for your enemies these cells are complicated to produce and take a lot of time to deploy but once they're ready they pack a real punch what makes your adaptive immune system so powerful is that it has the largest library in the universe it has an answer to everything you have at least one of these super weapon cells inside you to fight the black death the Corona virus and the first deadly bacteria that will emerge in a city on Mars in 100 years this makes it possible for you to counter the ability of bacteria and viruses to change so rapidly how is this possible to understand what's going on here we need to take one step back all organisms on Earth are made from the same basic parts mostly proteins proteins are the building blocks of life and can have billions of different shapes you can imagine them as 3D puzzle pieces there are billions of different puzzle pieces your enemies can use to construct their bodies why is this important because proteins are in a way the language of the microw world cells don't have eyes or ears so to tell friend from foe they have to touch them and recognize if their protein is part of a friend or part of an enemy recognizing means that cells have countless tiny devices called receptors that are able to connect with a specific protein puzzle piece so your cells have tiny puzzle pieces on on their outsides that are able to click together or recognize other protein puzzle pieces when a cell connects together with a protein and recognizes it as enemy it knows that it has to attack only if your cells can make this distinction between Friend or Foe is your immune system able to fight an Invader but since there are billions of possible protein puzzle pieces this means there are billions of possible enemy puzzle pieces this is also one of the reasons we still have to deal with diseases like the flu each year the influenza virus mutates very rapidly and so the proteins that make up its Hull constantly change a tiny bit the soldiers of your innate immune system have a large number of the puzzle pieces for common bacteria and viruses memorized that's why they are your allpurpose weapons but they are ineffective against many billions of mutations and adaptations that your enemies can develop so the reason you are still alive is that your adaptive immune system is able to recognize between 1 billion and 10 billion different enemy protein puzzle pieces which is enough to be prepared for every possible enemy but how is this possible how could your immune system possibly have this much of a variety to be prepared for every possible protein puzzle piece well the cells of your adaptive immune system found a cheat coat mixing and matching their own genetic code to create this stunning variety of receptors the details are way too complicated for this video but in a nutshell your adaptive immune cells have official permission to take a tiny part of their own genetic code and mix it in random ways to create billions of different receptors a good way to explain this is by asking you to imagine an army of cooks with each of them wanting their own special recipe they have 100 different ingredients to choose from each ingredient stands for one tiny piece of genetic code in this metaphor so each cook takes a few random ingredients and randomly mixes them together maybe tomato chicken rice and half an onion as entree marshmallow pepper strawberries and a quter banana as a dessert or cucumber beef potatoes and two carrots and blueberries chocolate and cream with a pinch of cinnamon even with slight variation and with only 100 ingredients there are billions of possible recipes and likewise with just a small selection of Jean fragments your cells create billions of re CHS the details of this are so cool that they should get their own video or their own chapter in a book in any case by mixing up Gene fragments you get up to 10 billion different combinations so in the end you get billions of immune cells and each of them has one specific and unique receptor the dish from our metaphor that is able to recognize one specific protein puzzle piece in total you end up with at least one cell for every enemy that could possibly exist but here we run into a pretty dangerous problem if your adaptive immune system is making weapons that can attack every possible protein puzzle piece in the universe wouldn't it also make some that can attack your own cells yes it happens all the time this is so fundamentally dangerous to your survival that you have a whole organ that does nothing but work on preventing this the murder University of your thymus your thymus is a chicken wing sized organ above your heart and you've probably never heard of it interestingly your thymus is one of the reasons why your immune system weakens as you age because it's in a constant state of decline once you reach puberty but what does the thymus do in your murder University your immune system is putting your adaptive immune cells through an intense and deadly curriculum basically it's showing them all sorts of protein puzzle pieces that are used by your own cells to see how they react when a young cell recogniz izes a body puzzle piece and wants to attack it the teacher cells order them to kill themselves and they are eaten up and recycled the immune system is so particular about this process that around 98% of your adaptive immune cells that enter murder University die there 2% graduate and get to do their job of protecting you for real if this process goes wrong and cells Escape that can recognize your own protein puzzle pieces this can lead to autoimmune disease where your immune system attacks your own body from the inside and this again is another story for another time okay let's summarize your immune system has two parts one that defends you right after birth and one that carries the largest library of super weapons in the universe but needs to boot up first to create billions of different super weapons your adaptive immune cells recombine a part of their genetic code to create a breathtaking variety of attack weapons then they enter a murder University that only 2% survive to make sure they don't attack you and then you end up with billions of different cells that in total are able to protect you against every possible enemy in the universe now wait a second if this is all true why do we get sick at all why was a new disease like covid-19 able to kill millions of people well everything we've just learned about is a tiny tiny window into the amazing struggle for life and death that plays out every day inside your body and there are so many amazing details and questions here how does your body actually find the right cell in time to protect you how do your enemies fight back and overcome your immune system anyway and what about all the things that didn't fit in this video well today finally marks the release of immune a journey into the mysterious system that keeps you alive written by Philip Detmer the founder and headwriter of kts AR first we had to push the release back because of cargo trouble and then because so many of you pre-ordered that we didn't have enough copies for the original launch day thank you so so much for that immune tells the Epic story of your immune system and will forever change how you think about your own body how you experience being sick and healthy the book is written to be as fun and easy to grasp as Kazar videos but is able to dive way deeper into its subject so go on a journey through the hidden microverse within yourself witness deadly Wars between billions of Invaders and cells learn how your immune system actually works and protects you from Cuts cancer and covid never before have we so urgently needed to learn about how immunity Works immune is fun and great to look at and it even smells good follow the link in the description to order it today this is the end of a decade long personal Journey working on this so thank you all so so much for your support and thank thank you for watching and [Music] reading
xaQJbozY_Is,2021-10-12T14:00:09.000000,What Dinosaurs ACTUALLY Looked Like?,"The past is a vast and mysterious land that
begins at the big bang and ends in the present, expanding with each passing moment. It is the home of everything that came before,
the key to understanding our present. Here we find the most amazing creatures to
ever roam our planet, hundreds of millions of species so diverse that our imagination
cannot do them justice. Unfortunately the past carefully guards its
secrets. While there are a lot of things about the
past we know, there are way more things we know we don’t know. And worse, there are probably even more things
we don’t even know that we don’t know about. Think of the wonder of life: We now recognize
about 1.5 million eukaryotic species but there may be as many as 10 million alive today. And although we are adding some 15,000 new
species to our collective knowledge each year, the vast majority of life on earth is still
undiscovered. This is just what is around today. An estimated four billion species emerged
on our planet in past eons. But at least 99% of them died out, way before
humans spoke the first words. The vast majority of all the different species
that ever existed are so utterly deleted that they have become part of the “unknown unknown”
part of the past, lost to us forever. Or are they? Could we use science and imagination to glimpse
a shadow of the unreachable past? Let us start with what we DO know. To learn about creatures of the past we need
fossils, any sort of remains preserved from past geological ages – bones or shells,
impressions or imprints, things preserved in amber. The totality of all fossils on earth is called
the fossil record and it is the most important window on the past we’ll ever have. For a dead animal to fossilize a number of
things must go just right: The right environment, timing and conditions. And then the fossil needs to survive for millions
or hundreds of millions of years and then get back to the surface – and then be discovered
before natural processes dissolve it. So it is kind of a miracle that we have what
we have and know what we know. Take the dinosaurs since they were one of
the largest and most successful groups of animals for some 165 million years – and
are also a lot of fun to animate. What were they really like and what are we
missing? In the last 200 years we’ve found tens of
thousands of fossils from over 1000 dinosaur species.. Lately we’ve entered a golden era of discovery
and about 50 new dinosaur species are discovered each year, expanding what we know and what
we know that we don’t know about them, which is amazing. But it also makes us aware of all the things
lost to the past forever. Imagine if we took all the animals that lived
in the last 50 million years and randomly chose 10000 individuals from 1000 species
to fossilize. Think about all the things that would be missed,
or that seem too weird to be true. Like the Giraffe, a yellow animal with brown
patterns that looks like a horse and an antelope had a baby, with a long neck and two tiny
hairy horns. How many “dinosaur giraffes” were there? Animals so weird and selected for ecological
niches so specific that evolution molded their bodies very absurdly - today they might seem
made up to us.. We know a lot of species are lost forever
just because of the environment they lived in. For example, lush jungles basically prevent
fossilization as the chances that an animal will be buried here is minimal. Countless scavengers of all sizes break down
freshly deceased animals extremely quickly and the soil is often so acidic that bones
are dissolved. And so fossils of dinosaurs from jungles are
practically nonexistent. Today half of all known species live in the
few remaining rainforests that only cover 2% of earth's landmass. Millions of years ago when dinosaurs roamed
earth, jungles covered much more of the planet. So besides some insects and other small animals
trapped in amber, there should be millions of species that emerged and vanished, without
leaving any trace. Trapped deep inside the unknown, unknown. But just in general biology trips us up. Look at your body. It’s mainly squishy, gooey, soft stuff. Which does not preserve well. What remains the longest are the crystalized
parts of your bones and so most dinosaur fossils are bones or teeth – usually fragments,
not entire skeletons. This means that almost all boneless or shell-less
animals are practically wiped from the fossil record. If we take a look at the stunning diversity
of weird animals like worms, jellyfish and slugs alive today we can only speculate what
we are missing. Although thankfully many mostly soft and gooey
species also left us an incredible diversity of shells that tell us an amazing amount about
our past, so at least we have that. Still when we think about all the boneless
species that may have existed in the last half billion years even our best attempt at
imagining them falls short. But it's not like reimagining something based
on its bones is straightforward and so the way we envisage what dinosaurs actually looked
like has changed a lot in the last few years. In the past many illustrations had a bony,
minimalistic look, with a toothy grin to signify fierceness and danger. But if we draw today's animals in a similar
way, based on their skeletons, just for the fun of it, we get the most bizarre creatures. Elephants, swans and baboons that look like
monsters right out of nightmares. So similar to animals today, we should imagine
dinosaurs with much more soft tissue, fat bellies or chests, weird soft parts like skin
flaps, lips and gums and just more pronounced features that would make them seem like much
more pleasant fellows. Some soft features actually leave distinctive
traces on bones that we can look for in the skeletons of extinct animals, which is where
today’s animals with similar features are really helpful. It’s a similar story with color. Because we know what the feathers of living
birds look like, modern technology combined with the exceedingly rare fossils with preserved
remains of fuzzy feathers give us a glimpse of the real colors of extinct dinosaurs. We know that tiny Sinosauropteryx had a striped
tail and its tiny dino buddy Anchiornis huxleyi was white and black with gorgeous red feathers
around its head. Still, for the vast majority of really any
ancient extinct species we have no real clue what color they were. But we know what modern dinosaurs, birds,
look like and here we find the most amazing variety. So some dinosaurs will have tried to blend
into the background, while others might have fielded aggressive color schemes to attract
mates or to appear dangerous. Some might have had impressive decorations
or colorful beaks. Some may have been striped or patterned. Similarly we don’t know that much about
dinosaur behaviour, although once again we can draw conclusions from existing animals. For example even apex predators like lions
spend a lot of their time lying around and cuddling and licking each other and playing. Why would dinosaurs be so different? When we first found the skull of T. rex with
its mighty teeth and probably the strongest bite of any land animal ever, we imagined
a fierce and stupid beast. But modern scanning technology has revealed
that T.rex had a larger brain-to-body ratio than some earlier giant meat-eaters. And it probably had very sharp hearing, vision
and sense of smell and was in all likelihood not a stupid animal. So maybe T.rex was a cuddly fellow that spent
a lot of time playing around or impressing potential mates when it was not hungry. Likewise, while their horns and shields might
have made ceratopsids appear to be natural born fighters, they were probably much more
than that. Based on the behaviour of modern animals and
the complex dances some have to go through to mate, maybe their shields were amazingly
colorful, maybe it danced for its mates like many birds do today. How intensely amazing these creatures must
have been. And what a loss it is to us that we don’t
get to experience them first hand. What an even greater loss that there is so
much we will never know about them and even more tragic, all the absurd and beautiful
beings that disappeared without a trace. But such is life – time marches on without
any concern for our feelings and the past expands with every moment that passes. Most wild animals alive today will in all
likelihood not leave fossils behind and also just disappear forever. We can do something about that though – instead
of accelerating the extinction we are witnessing we could become the guardians of life and
preserve it where we find it. If possible in the wild, if not then in museums,
movies and in our minds. Because as amazing as our imagination is,
and as fascinating to think about the animals that are part of the unknown unknown – it
is even better to witness them in the present."
0FRVx_c9T0c,2021-09-28T14:01:17.000000,Two Chapters From Our New Book – Exclusive Preview!,"hello everybody today we're doing something different an exclusive preview we'll listen to the introduction and a chapter from the ktz gazar book immune a journey into the mysterious system that keeps you alive written by ktz gazar founder and headwriter Philip debar it's about the Epic story of the immune system the most important thing you don't know enough about and will forever change how you think about your body immune will be released on November the 2nd and you can pre-order it right now links in the description so now get comfy for a rare Audio Only experience introduction imagine waking up tomorrow feeling a bit under the weather an annoying pain in your throat your nose is runny you cough a bit all in all not bad enough to skip work you think as you step into the shower pretty annoyed about how hard your life is while you are totally not being a whiny little baby your immune system is not complaining it is busy keeping you alive so you can live to Wine another day and so while Intruders roam your body killing hundreds of thousands of your cells your immune system is organizing complex defenses communicating over vast distances activating intricate defense networks and dishing out a swift death to Millions if not billions of enemies all while you are standing in the shower mildly annoyed but this complexity is largely hidden which is a real shame because there are not many things that have such a crucial impact on the quality of your life as your immune system it is all embracing and all-encompassing protecting you from bothersome nuisances like the common cold scratches and cuts to life-threatening stuff from cancer and pneumonia to deadly infections like covid-19 your immune system is as indispensable as your heart or your lungs and actually it is one of the largest and most widespread organ systems throughout your body although we don't tend to think about it in these terms for most of us the immune system is a vague and cloud-like entity that follows strange and untransparent rules and which seems to sometimes work and sometimes not it is a bit like the weather extremely hard to predict and subject to endless speculation and opinions resulting in actions that feel random to us unfortunately many people speak about the immune system with confidence but without actually understanding it it can be hard to know which information to trust and why but what even is the immune system and how does it actually work understanding the mechanisms that are keeping you alive as you read this is not just a nice exercise in intellectual curiosity it is desperate needed knowledge if you know how the immune system works you can understand and appreciate vaccines and how they can save your life or the lives of your children and approach disease and sickness with a very different mindset and far less fear you become less suceptible to snake Hall salesmen who offer Wonder drugs that are entirely devoid of logic you get a better grasp on the kinds of medication that might actually help you when you are sick you get to know what you can do to boost your immune Sy system you can protect your kids from dangerous microbes while also not being too stressed out if they get dirty playing outside and in the very unlikely case of say a global pandemic knowing what a virus does to you and how your body fights it might help you understand what the public health experts say besides all these practical and useful things the immune system is also Simply Beautiful a Wonder of nature like no other the immune system is not a mere tool to make your cough go away it is inextricably tied into almost all other processes in your body and while it is centrally important to keeping you alive it is likely that it may also be the part of your body that causes your untimely death either by failing or by being too active I have been fascinated and obsessed by the incredible complexity of the human immune system for the better part of a decade now it began in University with where I was studying information design and was looking for a semester project and the immune system seemed like a good idea so I got a large pile of books about immunology and began digging in but no matter how much I read things just did not get less complicated the more I learned the more impossible it seemed to simplify the immune system as every layer revealed more mechanisms more exceptions more complexity and so a project that was supposed to last the spring took the summer and then the fall and the winter the interactions of the parts of the immune system were too elegant and the dance they danced was too beautiful to stop learning about them this progress fundamentally changed how I experienced and felt about my body when I got the flu I could no longer just complain but had to look at my body touch my swollen lymph nodes and visualize what my immune cells were doing right then which part of the network was Act at and how te- cells killed millions of intruders to protect me when I cut myself while being careless in the forest I felt gratitude for my macras large immune cells hunting scared bacteria and ripping them into pieces to protect the open wound from infection after taking a bite of the wrong granola bar and suffering an allergic shock while being rushed to the hospital I thought about M cells and IG antibodies and how they had almost killed me in a misguided attempt to to protect me from scary food stuffs when I was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 32 and had to undergo a couple of operations and then chemotherapy my obsession with Immunology became even more intense one of the jobs of my immune system is to kill cancer in this case it had failed but I somehow could not be angry or too upset as I had learned how hard of a job this was for my immune cells and how hard cancer had to work to keep them in check and as the chemo melted the cancer my thoughts again went to my immune cells invading the dying tumors and eating them up one cell after another disease and sickness are scary and unsettling and I've had plenty of that in my life but knowing how my cells my immune system this integral and personal part of myself defended The Entity that is me how it fought and died and healed and restored this body I inhabit always gave me a lot of comfort learning about the immune system made my life better and more interesting and it alleviated a lot of the anxiety that comes with being sick knowing about the immune system always put things in perspective so because of this positive effect and just because of the fun of learning and reading about the immune system it became an ongoing hobby as I eventually became a science communicator and explaining complex things became my purpose in life about 8 years ago I started ktz kazak in a nutshell a YouTube channel dedicated to making information easy to understand and beautiful while trying to be as true to the science as possible in early 2021 the ktz kazak team has grown to over 40 people working on this Vision while the channel has attracted over 14 million subscribers and reaches about 30 million viewers each month so if this large platform exists why go through the horrible process of writing this book well while some of our most successful videos have been about the immune system it has always bugged me that I could not explore this wonderful Topic in the depth it deserves a 10-minute video is simply not the right medium for that so this book is a way to turn my decade long love affair with the immune system into something tangible that will hopefully be a helpful and entertaining way to learn about the stunning and beautiful complexity that makes it possible for you to survive each day unfortunately the immune system is very complicated although that is not strong enough a word the immune system is complicated in the sense that climbing Mount Everest is a nice stroll through nature it is intuitive like reading the Chinese translation of the tax code of Germany is a fun Sunday afternoon the immune system is the most complex biological system known to humanity other than the human brain the bigger the Immunology textbook you read the more layers of detail start piling on the more exceptions to rules appear the more intricate the system becomes the more specific it seems to be for every possible eventuality every single one of its many parts has multiple jobs and functions and areas of expertise that overlap and influence each other even if you make it past these challenges and still want to understand the immune system you will encounter another problem the humans who described it scientists have laid the foundation for the amazing modern world we get to enjoy today through hard work and endless curiosity and we owe them a great deal of gratitude unfortunately though many scientists are really bad at choosing good names and coming up with accessible language for the things they discover the science of Immunology is one of the worst culprits of any scientific discipline in this regard an already breathtakingly complex field is spiked with words like major histo compatibility complex class 1 and 2 Gamma Delta T cells interfere on Alpha Beta gamma and Kappa and the complement system with actors named C4 B2 a3b complex none of this makes it a pleasure to pick up a textbook and learn about the immune system on your own but even without this barrier the complex relationships of the many different actors of the immune system with countless exceptions and unintuitive rules are a challenge all by themselves Immunology is hard even for the people working in public health even for the people studying Immunology even for the foremost experts in the field all of this makes the immune system horrible to explain if you venture too far into simplification you deprive the learner of the beauty and wonder that lie in The evolutionary Genius of the sheer endless complexity that deals with the most crucial problems of living beings but if you include too much detail it quickly becomes mind-numbingly hard to keep up with listing everything every part of the immune system is just too much it would be like telling someone your whole life story on the first date overwhelming and very likely to make them less interested in dating you so my aim for this book is to try to carefully dance around all these problems it will use human language and use complicated words only when necessary where appropriate processes and and interactions will be simplified while staying as true to the science as possible complexity between chapters will go up and down so after you are fed a lot of information there will be more chill parts to relax a bit and we will summarize what we learned in regular intervals I want this book to make it possible for everybody to understand their own immune system and have a bit of fun doing so and since this complexity and Beauty are deeply connected to your health and survival you might actually learn something useful and of course the next time you are sick or have to deal with disease you hopefully can look at your body from a different perspective also the obligatory disclaimer I'm not an immunologist but a science communicator and immune system Enthusiast this book will not make every immunologist happy what became obvious right from the start of the research is that there are a lot of different ideas and Concepts about the details of the immune system and and there is a lot of disagreement between the scientists holding these ideas which is how science is supposed to work for example some immunologists consider certain cells useless fossils While others think they are crucial for your defenses so as much as possible this book is based on conversations with Scientists the current literature that is used to teach immunology and peer-reviewed papers still at some point in the future parts of this book will need an update which is a good thing the science of Immunology is a dynamic field where a lot of amazing things are happening and different theories and ideas are in flux with each other the immune system is a living topic where great discoveries are still happening which is great because it means we are learning more about ourselves and the world we live in okay before we jump in and explore what your immune system is doing let us Define the premise first so we have Solid Ground to stand on what is the immune system what is the context it works in and what are the tiny parts that do the actual work after we have covered these Basics we will explore what happens if you hurt yourself and how your immune system rushes in to defend you then we'll explore your most vulnerable parts and see how your body scrambles to protect from a serious infection and lastly we'll take a look at different immune disorders like allergies and autoimmune disease and discuss how you can boost your immune system but now let us get to the very beginning of this story two what is there to defend before we can really learn about your intricate defense system we should take a look at what needs to be defended your body in a sense this seems pretty straightforward it is the entire area under and including your skin simple enough right but just like looking at a planet in space you will never see anything remotely approaching the full picture from orbit so before we do anything else first we need to go on a journey together into a strange and foreign World Stranger Than the deep sea or an alien planet a world where no living being therein even knows that it exists where monsters are a daily reality but nobody cares a world billions of years old that exists within yourself within everybody and everything all around us omnipresent but invisible this is the world of the tiny where the border between dead and alive becomes fuzzy where biochemistry becomes life for reasons we still do not understand let us zoom into you and take a look into your organs through the tissue to our most fundamental building blocks your cells cells are extremely tiny living things among the smallest units of life on Earth for a single cell your body is a planet drifting through a hostile Universe to understand the enormous dimensions of your body we need to look at it from a cell's perspective at the scale of a cell your body is an utterly gigantic structure of pipes as wide as mountains filled with oceans of fluids rapid torren permeating intricate cave systems stretching as far as whole countries with the exception of the crystallized hard parts of your bones all of the environment all of the world really is to a cell alive a cell can politely ask a wall to let it pass and then squeeze through a tiny Gap that closes behind it it can swim through channels and hike up mountains of meat to get anywhere it needs to go if you were the size of one of your cells the body of a human would be in the area of 15 to 20 mount everestsolar it would be a mountain of Flesh at least 60 M 100 km tall reaching into space if you are near a window take a second and look into the sky try to imagine this for a moment a giant so large that passenger planes would crash against its lower legs its head so far above you that you would not be able to see it the cells of your immune system are tasked to defend all of that especially the weak points where Intruders can enter it which is mostly the borders the outsides of the body when you think about your outsides the first thing that comes to mind is of course your skin the total surface area of your skin is about 2 square yards M about half the size of a pool table and luckily is not that hard to defend since most of it is made out of a hard and thick barrier covered with its own defense system it feels soft but it is pretty hard to breach if it is intact your real weak points to infections are your mucous membranes the surface that lines your windpipe and lungs eyelids mouth and nose your stomach and intestines your reproductive tracts and bladder it is hard to give their total surface area since numbers vary so much from person to person but on average there are about 200 square yards meters of mucous membranes in a healthy adult about the same as a tennis court most of them being your lungs and your digestive tract you may mistakenly think of your mucous membranes as your inside but this is not true your mucous membranes are outside if we took an honest look at what you are you are in a sense nothing more than a complex tube granted a tube that can close both ends also a lot wetter slimier and grosser your reproductive organs nostrils and ears are extra holes entrances to large tunnels and additional cave systems that reach through you all of these places are your direct borders contact points with the outside world your body is just wrapped around them these outsides within your insides represent surfaces where millions of intruders are trying to enter you every day a lot of ground to defend when you are the size of a cell for your cells the surface area of the mucus membranes is is as big as Central Europe or the central United States are to you building border walls would not do the trick for them since they don't need to defend just the borders but the entire surface it's not like intruders are trying to enter just at the edges they could sort of drop in with parachutes so your cells need to defend the entire continent all of it still it's much easier to catch an enemy at one of these points than somewhere else for examp example if we took all the blood vessels and capillaries from your body and laid them out in a straight line they would be a baffling 74,000 M 120,000 km long three times the circumference of Earth with about 1,400 square yards 1,200 M of surface area so better catch enemies at the borders that are significantly smaller and therefore easier to defend but easier does not mean easy let's do a fun experiment and imagine that we wanted to build a human body to scale but from actual people like Q living breathing humans just to see what sort of crazy Dimensions we encounter here so first we need a lot of people for that the average human body is made from around 40 trillion cells trillion 40 trillion is 40000000000 0000 a truly impressive number if we want yourselves to be represented by individual people then we need more than 100 times as many people as have lived in the 250,000 yearlong history of humanity let's try to visualize this a bit right now around 7.8 billion people are alive if we put them shoulder-to-shoulder they surprisingly would only cover an area of around 700 100 square mil 1,800 km which is a little bit more than the surface area of London to get 40 trillion people we need to multiply this by 120 and this is only half of the story because your body hosts bacteria that you need to survive how many one bacterium for each of the 40 trillion cells in your body which happens to be a pretty good ballpark in terms of size if you were the size of an average body cell a bacterium would be roughly the size of a bunny let us imagine them as baby bunnies to make the thought less horrifying most of these cute bunnies live in your gut in this ginormous cave 36 trillion bunnies live their lives constantly dying and reproducing breaking down chunks of food the size of skyscrapers so it can be distributed to all the people making up the continent to flesh the other four trillion bunnies are crawling on your skin are inside your lungs hopping over your teeth your tongue they swim in the fluid of your eyes crawl in and out of your ears we'll talk more about them later but for now just imagine yourself is being covered by cute bunnies who are your friends and have only your best interests in mind okay so we now have 40 trillion people standing shoulder Tosh shoulder this ocean of people would cover the whole of the United Kingdom every last Corner Lake and Mountain to make a body to scale made of people represent presenting cells we need to stack them until trillions of people are standing on top of each other holding hands and linking arms forming living structures a giant made out of Flesh Rises 60 Mi 100 km into the sky reaching the edge of space the giant is made up of caverns as wide as small countries bones as dense and wide as mountains filled with intricate caves and tunnels its arteries are filled with oceans of fluid and people carrying food and oxygen tanks to every last Corner if you were a red blood cell or in this case red blood person you would travel the distance from Paris to Rome and back once a minute in a stream pumped by a heart as large as a city things could be great everybody would work together to keep the mountain of Flesh and in consequence themselves alive but the enormous richness of resources and food and the abundance of warm space is just too attractive the giant is not only the size of a continent for its inhabitants but also for unwelcome visitors literally billions of parasites are trying to get inside the flesh giant some are as large as Elephants or blue whales and they want to lay giant eggs so their young can Feast on the poor people that make up the tissues others are the size of raccoons or rats who want to steal the food and make the giant their permanent home home to raise generations of their offspring they may not intend to harm the people making up the body but they will do so by defecating everywhere making life miserable the most disgusting Vermin our flesh giant has to deal with daily are billions of spiders who want to enter the cell people's mouths or ears to breed in the stomachs of their victims for a giant made up of trillions of people losing a few here and there is not really dangerous but if the Vermin were allowed to create freely it could be its end isn't the idea horrifying this is what your sales deal with every single day and night from your birth until the day you die Staying Alive is not a thing you should take for granted but don't let this idea of being attacked distress you too much you are not just a mountain of Flesh waiting to be conquered thankfully you have a great Ally in this fight for survival that as we now know we simply don't cherish and celebrate as much as it deserves your immune system it makes you a fortress and even more a fortress filled with billions of the most effective and fierce soldiers in the universe they have countless weapons at their disposal and they use them without mercy your immune system Army has already killed billions of enemies and parasites in your life and it is ready to kill billions or trillions more okay that's it for now if you want to learn more about the Epic tale of your immune system you can pre-order the book via the links below it's available as an audio book and as a real book with 45 illustrations in German and English thank you for listening [Music]"
yiw6_JakZFc,2021-09-22T13:59:24.000000,Can YOU Fix Climate Change?,"Never before in human history have we been
richer, more advanced or powerful. And yet we feel overwhelmed in the face of
rapid climate change. It seems simple on the surface. Greenhouse gases trap energy from the Sun
and transfer it to our atmosphere. This leads to warmer winters, harsher summers. Dry places become drier and wet places wetter. Countless ecosystems will die while the rising
oceans swallow coasts and the cities we build on them. So why don’t we just like… prevent all
of that? Well, it’s complicated. The public debate about stopping rapid climate
change often focuses on a few key features, like coal plants, cars or burping cows. And so the solutions are often simplistic
– rows of solar panels, biking to work, something something sustainability. And a huge talking point is personal responsibility. How YOU should change your lifestyle to prevent
rapid climate change, which we will find out together in the next few minutes. This is one of those videos where we want
to encourage you to watch to the end, because to discuss real doable solutions, we first
need to understand  the problem. A Fuller Picture Modern industrial society as we constructed
it in the last 150 years, is inherently destructive to the planet. Basically everything we do to make our lives
easier, safer and more comfortable is making things worse for the biosphere. The food we eat, the streets we walk on, the
clothes we wear, the gadgets we use, the way we move around and the pleasant temperatures
we artificially create around us. While most people know about the serious impact
of energy, beef, cars and planes, many major polluters are barely ever talked about. The emissions leaking out of landfills are
as significant as the emissions of all the jets in the air. More CO2 is released to run our homes than
from all cars combined. And the emissions produced when making a new
car is equivalent to building just two metres of road. So it is nice to switch to electric cars but
they won’t solve anything if we keep building roads the same way. Fixing one small part of the industrial system
is not enough. Each of the many different parts needs its
own solution and many of them aren’t straight forward. But even where we know what to do, just because
a solution exists doesn’t mean we are able or willing to implement it. There are many gray areas in the fight against
rapid climate change, the most prominent one is the divide between rich and poor. Emissions vs poverty There is a clear connection between the prosperity
of a nation and its carbon emissions. In other words, richer people tend to cause
more emissions. So the key to fixing climate change is simply
for the world’s richest to cut back on their extravagant lifestyles right? While this would help, it wouldn’t make
the problem go away. This is because 63% of global emissions come
from low to middle income countries. Countries where most people are not living
extravagantly but are trying to escape poverty at worst, and achieve a comfortable lifestyle
at best. The unfortunate reality is that, currently,
escaping poverty and becoming middle class creates unavoidable emissions. So asking developing countries to cut emissions
just looks like an attempt to keep them down. It is very hard to argue that a region should
protect their primeval forests and spend money on solar panels instead of burning wood, when
it can’t meet basic needs for significant parts of its population. So, cutting back is not a popular demand,
especially if the countries making these demands got rich by causing environmental damage in
the past. For billions of people, more emissions are
a good thing personally. When we forget about this, we tend to propose
unworkable solutions. Take concrete. 8% of CO2 emissions are released by the concrete
manufacturing industry. Ok cool, stop using concrete, right? But right now, concrete is also a cheap and
easy way for growing populations in developing countries to build affordable housing. And there are many examples like that. Even rich countries aren’t immune from disagreeing
about rapid climate change solutions. Banning coal, gas and oil from the energy
mix is slowed down by heated discussions about what should replace them. Citizens can be strictly against nuclear power
but also oppose wind or solar infrastructure in their backyards. In principle all of these issues can be overcome
– but there are things we don’t currently know how to overcome. The most problematic one is food. Emit or Die We will soon need to feed 10 billion people,
and we don’t know how to do that without emitting greenhouse gases. Because of the nature of modern food production
that requires fertilizers or manure, it is impossible to have zero-emissions food. Rice alone emits so much methane each year
that it practically equals the emissions of all the air traffic in the world. What’s worse is that the foods we like the
most emit the most. 57% of food emissions come from animal-based
foods, although they make up only 18% of the world’s calories, and 37% of its protein. And as people across the world grow richer,
they want more meat. Traditional diets in most cultures were primarily
plant based with a little meat on top. But with the rise of industrial style meat
production and factory farming, meat has become a staple food; a regular indulgence in developed
countries and a symbol of status and wealth in developing countries. Today about 40 percent of the world’s habitable
land is used for meat production in some form or another, the size of North and South America
combined. This is land on which we could otherwise allow
native ecosystems to regrow, like forests in the Amazon, and suck carbon out of the
atmosphere, but instead most of it is used to feed animals. The available solutions are uniquely able
to make everybody on the political spectrum, rich or poor, unhappy. Meat is highly emotional and there are a lot
of whataboutism arguments floating around, like comparing it to the worst sources of
emissions. In the end it is pretty simple: eating less
meat alone won’t stop climate change, but we also can’t stop climate change without
eating less meat. The same holds true for other things that
are less crucial to our survival but frankly not realistic to make go away. Like air travel, oversea shipping, mining
and the production of devices that play youtube videos. So what does this mean? Do we need to give up our way of life and
can the poor never achieve it? Can’t some technology save us so we can
continue to drive our big cars and eat meat every day? Solutions vs Expenses In principle, this technology already exists:
Direct Air Capture of CO2 draws carbon dioxide from the air so that it can be stored underground
or transformed into products. So why aren’t we implementing it in every
industry, everywhere? Because with the technology we have right
now, this would cost some ten trillion dollars per year, or half the United States’ GDP. This money has to come from somewhere and
currently no-one is offering it. Just dumping these costs on massive polluters
like steel mills and coal power stations would double the cost of their products – and
so these industries that operate on very tight profit margins would go bankrupt. Getting the government to pay for it seems
logical but a lot of state resources are actually tied up doing the opposite, like subsidizing
oil and gas. Which seems counter intuitive but follows
clear incentives. By artificially keeping fuel prices low, shipping
and everyday goods are kept artificially cheap too. Which has a major social impact on billions
of people around the world. That creates political lobbies and incentives
that perpetuate this cycle that makes it so hard to cut off fossil fuel production. Meanwhile, very costly solutions for a far-off
problem like carbon capture seem like they can wait, as technically nobody benefits from
it right now. Some argue that a move away from capitalism
is the only solution to this mess, others insist that markets should be even freer,
without any interventions like subsidies and some suggest that we need what’s referred
to as “degrowth” and to cut back as a species overall. But the truth is at least as of now, no political
system is doing an impressive job at becoming truly sustainable and none have really done
so in the past. We also don’t have the time to figure this
out and do a lot of experiments. We must implement solutions now. Not just to halt the release of all possible
greenhouse gases, but also to start reducing the amount of CO2 in the air. It’s too late to just mend our ways, we
have to actively correct our past mistakes. With every year we waste, more extreme changes
will be unavoidable. Ok. Let’s take a deep breath. Rapid climate change and the world we live
in are complicated. So here is where YOU, dear viewer, come in
again. Could YOU please fix the climate? A narrative of our time is that we are all
responsible for rapid climate change. That everyone needs to play their part. Why don’t you buy a new electric car? Why don’t you replace your gas stove with
an electric one? How about you double glaze your windows, stop
eating meat and switch off your lights? Shifting responsibility from the largest carbon
emitters to the average person, you, is much easier to do than solving problems. There’s an extra bonus if solving rapid
climate change sells a new product. If you don’t have the money or time for
these things, you should feel bad. It’s an effective message because it is
true. The quickest way to cut CO2 emissions would
be if all rich populations on Earth drastically changed their lifestyles and if the people
on the rise would not seek to achieve it. Favouring the climate over comfort and wealth. If you are able to watch this video, this
includes you. But we’ve just witnessed a global experiment
in staying at home, not using transport and consuming less during the coronavirus pandemic. And all it did was reduce CO2 emissions by
7% for 2020. Asking average people to solve rapid climate
change breaks down when we look at the scale of the problem. Personal contributions toward reducing greenhouse
gas emissions are nice, but they are dwarfed by the systemic reality of global emissions. The concept of your personal carbon footprint
was popularized by the oil producer BP in a 2005 ad campaign. Arguably one of the most effective and sinister
pieces of propaganda that still seriously distracts all of us from the reality of the
situation. If you eliminated 100% of your emissions for
the rest of your life, you would save one second’s worth of emissions from the global
energy sector. Even the most motivated person can’t even
make a tiny dent. When we put together the dangers of rapid
climate change, the scale of emissions and the lack of consensus over how to solve it,
the challenge seems insurmountable. It can cause decision fatigue and moral licensing,
where you no longer feel bad about behaving in a counter productive way. We have struggled a long time with this, which
is why this video took us so long to make. So. What can you actually do? There are many different takes and they are
passionately discussed. We don’t know who is right, so we can only
offer you the Kurzgesagt perspective and opinion. Opinion Part: What can you ACTUALLY do? We need a different way to think and talk
about rapid climate change. An all-encompassing systemic approach, nothing
less than changing the fundamentals of our modern industrial societies. As discussed in frustrating length, the personal
responsibility angle is overplayed. For systemic changes in technology, politics
and the economy of this magnitude, we need to influence the people at the levers. Politicians need to know and feel strongly
that the people care, that their own success depends on tackling rapid climate change. When governments and local politicians are
reluctant to change laws that affect their biggest tax contributors or campaign donors,
we need to vote them out and vote in people who respect science. We need to hold them accountable for implementing
the most effective climate change strategies. Not waste our time with things like banning
plastic straws but by moving the big levers: Food, transportation and energy while not
forgetting the smaller ones like cement or construction. When industries fight against changing their
ways, for fear of losses or in an honest attempt to protect their own, we need politicians
to change the laws and incentivise the deployment of existing technologies and massively invest
in innovation for the fields where we don’t have great solutions yet. There is no reason that the profit interests
of industries could not match the need to reduce carbon emissions as much as possible. And if they still don’t cooperate harsh
punishments and regulation need to force or bankrupt them. It's still unrealistic that change of that
scope can be forced onto a worldwide economy quickly enough, because many low carbon technologies
still need a lot of time and research – which means they are expensive. But more companies will make more efficient
carbon capture systems, tasty meat alternatives, better batteries, cement alternatives and
so on, if there is a clear and growing demand. And if you are affluent enough, you can do
your part by investing in these things right now while they're still expensive. These are the mechanisms that will drive the
prices down later on. So this is basically what you can do. Vote at the ballot, vote with your wallet. There are too many opposing interests and
complicated grey zones. In the end if we truly get the systemic change
we need, everybody will be unhappy about some aspect of it. Only if we all accept that some solutions
will have negative impacts for us, can we have an honest conversation and make progress. Everybody will be a little unhappy. And that is ok. This is the best you can do. You can deal with the reality of the situation
and promote your priorities through your behaviour and your actions. And while you do so, you can eat less meat,
fly less or get an electric car. Not because you should feel guilty if you
don’t or because you naively believe that you alone can stop rapid climate change – but
to do your tiny, tiny part for the systemic change we need. This video was supported by Gates Notes, the

1-NxodiGPCU,2021-08-31T13:59:40.000000,This Virus Shouldn't Exist (But it Does),"hidden in the microverse all around you there's 
a merciless war being fought by the true rulers   of this planet microorganisms amoeba protists 
bacteria archaea and fungi compete for resources   and space and then there are the strange horrors 
that are viruses hunting everyone else not even   alive they are the tiniest most abundant and 
deadliest beings on earth killing trillions every   day not interested in resources only in living 
things to take over also we thought turns out   there are giant viruses that blur the line between 
life and death and other viruses hunting them considerably smaller than your cells or even 
bacteria viruses are nothing but a hull a tiny   bit of genetic material and a few proteins no 
metabolism no way to propel themselves no will   or ambition they float around aimlessly and hope 
to stumble upon a victim to infect and take over   viruses are so simple that we're not sure 
if they should count as living things or not   some scientists argue viruses are alive others 
think that the cells they infect are the actual   living viruses hybrid organisms called viral 
cells and the viral particles are more like seeds   or spores and many others think viruses are just 
dead material the origin of viruses is a mystery   because how can something that needs victims 
to make more of itself emerge in the first   place there are many ideas viruses may have been 
essential steps in the emergence of life or maybe   they started out as escaped dna from cells that 
became really good at making copies of themselves   maybe they are the descendants of truly lazy 
parasites that let others do all the work for   them the current thinking is that viruses probably 
emerged multiple times from different origins   but we simply don't know for sure yet whatever the 
truth is viruses are the most successful beings on   this planet there's an estimated 10 000 billion 
billion billion viruses on earth if we put them   all next to each other they would stretch for 100 
million light years 500 milky way galaxies wide   very recently viruses became even weirder 
when scientists found a completely new type   giant viruses nicknamed gyrus not only did it 
break all sorts of records but questioned many   assumptions we had about their nature gyruses 
even come with their own parasites virophages   viruses that hunt other viruses which seemingly 
makes no sense at all and since we identified the   first one in 2003 it seems like these giants 
are everywhere we look in the oceans in water   towers in the guts of pigs and the mouths of 
humans and they're even weirder than we thought   gyruses look funny like hairy geometric 
forms or mini pickles much larger than   all viruses we knew before which explains how 
they could hide in plain sight for centuries   scientists saw them under their microscopes 
and just thought they had to be bacteria   it's like suddenly discovering there 
are elephant-sized ducks everywhere   most gyruses we've found so far hunt amoebi and 
other single-celled beings when they find a victim   they connect with it and use its natural processes 
to enter the cell like all viruses their goal is   to misappropriate the victim's infrastructure and 
procreate imagine a mouse crawling into your mouth   and using your guts and bones and 
fat tissue to build a mouse factory   the gyrus unloads its attack proteins and genetic 
material and rearranges the cell from the inside   its structural elements protein production 
machinery and large amounts of mitochondria   for energy are changed to become an actual 
factory called viroplasm some gyruses even   construct a membrane to shield them from the 
cell's antiviral defenses once finished the   viroplasm begins to assemble new gyruses using 
the victim up from the inside until it's filled up   finally the invader usually orders the cell to 
self-destruct and releases new gyruses to look   for new prey but what makes gyruses special 
is not their modus operandi or their size even   it's that they are much more complex than thought 
possible for a virus your cells have around 20   000 genes a typical bacterium has a few thousand 
genes the coronavirus has around 15 hiv or the flu   around 10. the number of genes alone is certainly 
not everything the tomato for example has 35   000 genes but generally we think of life as a 
complex system so below a certain complexity level   something may be closer to dead material 
rather than a living organism but gyruses   can have hundreds or even thousands of genes 
blurring the line between living and dead things   and it's not just the numbers that are special 
but also what these genes do we used to think of   viral genes as the simplest of instructions just 
enough to overcome the defense of their victims   and make new viruses but many gyrus genes 
are completely unique basically mystery genes   even more confusing a huge selection of their 
genes that are actually hallmarks of living   things genes that regulate nutrient intake energy 
production light harvesting replication or are   just necessary to keep cells alive some recent 
studies have even suggested that some gyruses   with very complex genomes may be able to maintain 
a basic level of metabolism on their own which if   true will shake up what we thought of viruses 
even more we still don't know anything for sure   but one idea about gyrus genes is that they might 
fundamentally alter the physiology and evolution   of their victims by integrating their own genomes 
and merging with them into chimeric organisms   or the other way around take some host genes with 
them and be changed themselves for billions of   years gyruses may have been existing alongside 
and infecting cells exerting an unseen influence   on the development of life not just as a parasite 
but jerking evolution in different directions by   mixing genes around in all directions which brings 
us to another unique thing about them virophages   the viruses hunting gyruses the concept itself is 
a bit mind-boggling how can a thing that might be   dead hunt another thing that might be dead too 
let's look at one of them the viruphage sputnik   is hunting a gyrus called mama virus that 
itself is hunting amoebi sputnik is a tiny   minimalistic virus that doesn't even have 
the genes and tools to replicate itself   what it does have is the ability to hijack the 
viroplasm factories of mama viruses so virophages   need their victim the gyrus to infect their victim 
an amoeba first and then they can parasitize it   a memovirus viroplasm infected by sputnik can only 
produce very few new gyruses and among these many   are deformed and broken unable to infect further 
cells instead it makes loads of new sputnik   viruphages other virophages are even more subtle 
when they infect a viroplasm they just integrate   their genetic code into the newly produced gyruses 
like sleeper agents the next time one of these   infiltrated gyruses successfully infects a cell 
it produces mostly viruphages instead of gyruses   gyruses are not completely defenseless 
though a few years ago the world was in   awe when scientists discovered crispr a bacterial 
defense system against viruses it turns out some   gyruses have a system that might be similar a 
sort of gyrus immune system against virophages   in turn virophages can also be used as an 
antigyrus defense mechanism by living cells   some protests have been found that integrated the 
genetic code of virophages into their genome and   kept it when the protists were infected by gyruses 
they used the code to create virophages themselves   to take over the gyrus factories in the end 
the protists would still be killed by the gyrus   infection but instead of releasing gyruses to kill 
its buddies it released virophages to hunt them   the amazing thing about everything we've told you 
in this video is that we're still very much at the   beginning it's not even been 20 years since the 
discovery of gyruses and virophages there is so   much going on in the microverse life is not an 
isolated event but a ping pong game of trillions   of organisms and viruses so when you feel down and 
like there's not that much new to discover think   of gyruses and all the other elephant-sized ducks 
all around us invisible until we look more closely  "
lXfEK8G8CUI,2021-08-10T13:59:41.000000,How The Immune System ACTUALLY Works – IMMUNE,"the human immune system is the most complex biological system we know after the human brain and yet most of us never learn how it works or what it is your immune system consists of hundreds of tiny and two large organs it has its own transport Network spread throughout your body every day it makes hundreds of billions of fresh cells organized like an army with soldiers captains Intelligence Officers heavy weapons and crazy suicide bombers it's not some sort of abstract entity your immune system is you your biology protecting you from the billions of microorganisms that want to consume you and from your own perverted cells that turn into cancer it's so manifold that it's impossible to cover in one video so we'll make a series looking at different aspects of it today what happens when your body is invaded and your first lines of defenses are engaged in a fight for life and [Music] death it's been a normal day when suddenly the world explodes and an asteroid rips the sky open countless alien life forms invade ready to destroy cities and infrastructure and eat civilians or this is what your cells experience you look at your bleeding thumb that you just cut on a dirty twig in the park how annoying but inside the wound a horrible catastrophe has happened there are dead cells and blood and dirt everywhere even worse countless bacteria invade the warm Caverns between your helpless cells to explore their new home steal your resources and poop everywhere immediately the first stage of your defense kicks in the cells that survived the impact or are hurt or dying scream in panic releasing an onslaught of chemical alarm signals that awaken your immune system the first cells to show up are macrofagos if an average cell were the size of a human a maccrage would be the size of a black rhino a stoic cell in principle but you wouldn't want to annoy it bacteria do annoy them within seconds the large cells attack and begin killing them without Mercy they stretch out Parts like the Arms of an octopus and grab the bacteria to swallow them whole and digest them alive a maccrage can eat 100 bacteria before it's exhausted but there are too many enemies so the macras is call for reinforcements in your blood hundreds of thousands of neutrophils pick up their signals and move to the battlefield neutrophils are intense suicide Warriors that only live to kill they're so enthusiastic itic about killing that they kill themselves a few days after birth so they don't have time to accidentally destroy your body from the inside as soon as neutrophils arrive they begin vomiting deadly chemicals at bacteria or devour them they are so careless in their attacks that they are causing real damage to your own cells but collateral damage is not their concern now orever some neutrophils go so far to push their suicide button and explode casting wide and toxic Nets made from their own DNA filled with deadly chemicals that trap and kill bacteria sometimes they can continue fighting after that even though they're sort of dead already this is how much fun they have killing while the battle rages your blood vessels let fluid stream into the battlefield like a dam opening up towards a valley you notice this as inflammation your thumb swells up a little and gets red and warm the fluid brings a silent killer into the Battle Zone millions of compliment proteins a sort of automated liquid weapon that stuns and kills bacteria by ripping holes into them we made a whole video explaining them in detail we're reaching a crossroad now if things go well your first line of defense kills the Invaders quickly but sometimes the enemies are too strong and would overwhelm your defenses eventually which means certain death for you the human this is the hour of the dendritic cell your immune system's intelligence officer while your soldiers were bashing in heads it was collecting samples by ripping bacteria into tiny parts and covering itself in it like a soldier decorating itself in the guts of a dead enemy the cell leaves the battlefield and enters the Super Highway of your immune system that connects all your tissues with your immune headquarters your lymph nodes the dendritic cell coming from the battlefield is looking for a helper te cell which is a sort of allpurpose Commander cell within your immune Army but not any helper te cell one that happens to have just the right weapon for the bacteria that infected your wound so it goes around and rubs itself still covered in bacteria Parts against every helper tea cell it meets most tea cells are a bit disgusted and not interested but after a few hours something clicks a helper te cell recognizes the bacteria parts this cell is the weapon that's needed right now the dendritic cell is overjoyed and activates the helper te cell okay wait how come your immune system has a cell that has a weapon against the specific bacteria that infected you well your immune system has a perfect weapon against every possible disease in the universe against the Black Death the Corona virus or an infection that will emerge in 100 years on Mars we'll talk about this a bit more in the the next video because it's very complex so for now just know that you have billions of unique helper te cells that each have weapons against every possible enemy after the right te- cell is activated your second line of defense awakes and Rises like a teenager that needs to get up on a school day very slowly your heavy weapons are incredibly effective but they're not fast the activated helper te cell begins to clone itself over and over again one becomes two two become four until there are thousands of them now they split into two groups the first group quickly moves to help out your soldiers at the battlefield things are getting out of hand a tired maccrage is ready to give up after fighting for days it just wants to go to sleep like many of its buddies have done already but now the helper tea cells arrive one of them comes to the tired maccrage and Whispers something using special chemical signals in a heartbeat the demoralized soldier feels fresh again but there's something else a hot white anger the maccrage knows what it needs to do kill invigorated it throws itself against the enemies once again all over the battlefield this begins to happen meanwhile the second group of hel cells was working on activating another line of defense B cells your antibody factories antibodies are protein super weapons that look like tiny crabs with two Pines to grab enemies just like the helper T cells there are B cells in your body that are able to make just the right antibodies for every possible enemy and the helper T cell is looking for exactly these B cells after a day or two the right B cell is found and begins to clone itself as soon as enough clones have been made each B cell begins pumping out up to 2,000 antibodies per second about a week after you injured yourself and bacteria invaded your second line of defense finally arrives in full force the tiny Army begins to saturate the battlefield pinching and stunning desperate bacteria the antibodies Clump them together and make them unable to move or fight while your soldiers Massacre the defenseless victims the tide is turning fast as the last enemies are cleaned up your soldiers realize they are no longer needed and begin to kill themselves to save resources but not all of them a few helper te cells remain and turn into memory cells they will guard the tissue for years making sure the same bacteria will never again gain a foothold here similarly a few B cells will stay alive and keep producing a low amount of antibodies making you immune against this bacteria maybe for the rest of your life one day you wake up and notice that the wound has grown over and left nothing but but a faint red mark you were completely unaware of the drama yourselves had to deal with for you the whole ordeal was a slight annoyance while for millions of cells it was a desperate fight for life and death but this is just the beginning of the Epic story that unfolds inside you every day and is told in full in immune a journey into the mysterious system that keeps you alive written by Philip Demmer the founder and headwriter of ktz kazak the book is a beautifully Illustrated deep dive into the immune system the most important thing you don't know enough about that will forever change how you think about your

on a journey and get to know your own body from Mystery organs murder universities to the largest library in the universe explore how incredibly vast your immune system is and how it actually works how it fights enemies from cancer to HIV or just the flu learn how you can boost it and if that's actually a good idea the book will be out in 6 weeks and it would mean the world to us and philli if

0FH9cgRhQ-k,2021-08-03T13:59:22.000000,The Largest Black Hole in the Universe - Size Comparison,"The largest things in the 
universe are black holes.   In contrast to things like planets or 
stars they have no physical size limit,   and can literally grow endlessly. Although in 
reality specific things need to happen to create   different kinds of black holes, from really tiny 
ones to the largest single things in the universe.   So how do black holes grow and how 
large is the largest of them all? This video will not discuss how black holes work 
or how they form since we’ve looked at that in   detail in our black hole and neutron star series, 
you can check them out afterwards. For now we are   interested in finding the largest thing in the 
universe. Let us start really, really small. Primordial Black holes The smallest kind of black holes may or may not 
exist. If they do, they are probably the oldest   objects in the universe, older even than atoms. 
They would have formed just after the big bang,   when the universe was so dense with 
violent energy, that any tiny pocket   that was just slightly more dense than 
its neighbors could produce a black hole. The smallest Primordial Black Hole that 
could still be around would be a trillion   kilograms or so, the mass of a big mountain. 
And yet they would be no bigger than a proton.   A Primordial Black hole with the mass of 
earth would barely be larger than a coin.   This makes them very hard to find, so we 
haven’t actually observed any yet – if   they exist they may even be the mysterious 
dark matter that holds galaxies together. Let’s move on to the kinds of black holes 
that we know for sure ARE out there. Stellar Black Holes To make a black hole we need to compress enough 
matter so that it collapses into itself. After   that, the more mass we throw at it, the 
larger it becomes. In today's universe,   only the most violent cosmic events can create 
the necessary conditions, such as the merger of   neutron stars or when the core of a very massive 
star collapses in a supernova. To have a unit to   work with here, we’ll use the mass of our sun, 
about 2 million trillion trillion kilograms. The smallest known black hole 
has 2.7 times the mass of the sun   which works out as a sphere around 16 km 
in diameter, large enough to cover Paris. Another lightweight black hole is the 
companion to the V723 Mon red giant star.   This star is 24 times larger than our sun, 
30 million kilometer in diameter. And yet,   it is thrown around by a tiny black hole 
just 17.2 km wide. This tiny thing bullying   the star is so much smaller that we can 
barely even show them in comparison. One of the largest known stellar black holes is 
M33 X-7. It currently spends its time eating a 70   solar mass blue giant, bit by bit. As all that 
stolen matter circles towards the black hole,   like water going down a drain, friction heats 
it up to temperatures high enough to shine   500,000 times brighter than our Sun! And 
yet, X-7 is ‘only’ 15.65 solar masses   and 92 km wide, just big enough 
to cast a shadow on Corsica. To grow much larger, black holes have to either 
devour a lot of stars or better, merge with one   another. The instruments that make it possible 
to detect these mergers are very new so we are   currently discovering a lot of exciting things. 
Like two massive black holes that we detected in   a galaxy 17 billion lightyears away. As they spun 
around each other violently, they released more   energy in the form of gravitational waves than the 
combined light from all the stars in the milky way   in 4400 years. The new black hole they formed is 
about the size of Germany and is 142 solar masses. And here we hit a curious gap in scale. There are lots of black holes up to 150 solar 
masses. And then there is nothing for a long   time. Until we suddenly hit black holes, 
that are millions of times more massive. Which is a bit confusing, because we had this 
idea that black holes are consistently growing   and growing. But for the most massive black holes 
this process is not fast enough to explain their   existence today. The universe is simply not 
old enough for these supermassive black holes   to have formed by eating stars and merging with 
each other. Something else must have happened. To explain how we got the largest black 
holes in the universe, we might need the   largest stars that ever existed: Quasi Stars. 
To get a sense of scale, we can compare them   to the largest stars that exist today. Our 
Sun is like a grain of sand next to them. We don’t know if Quasi Stars actually existed but 
they are an interesting concept when it comes to   supercharging black hole development. The idea is 
that the matter in the early universe was so dense   that quasi stars could grow to thousands of 
times the mass of our sun. The cores of these   stars might have been crushed by their own weight 
so much to actually collapse into black holes   while the star was still forming. In contrast to 
stars today that would destroy themselves in the   process, inside quasi stars, a deadly balance 
could emerge. Gravity pressed the supermassive   star together, feeding the black hole and heating 
the material falling in to such a degree that the   radiation pressure kept the star stable. And so 
these quickly growing black holes might have been   able to consume the quasi star for millions of 
years and grow far bigger than any modern stellar   black hole. Black holes several thousand times the 
mass of the Sun and wider than the entire earth. These black holes might have become 
the seeds for supermassive black holes. Supermassive black holes So now, we arrive at the kings of our 
universe, the largest single bodies in   existence. The centers of most galaxies contain a 
super massive black hole, and they are monstrous. In the Milky Way we have Sagittarius A 
Star, a super massive black hole with   about 4 million solar masses that is calm and 
collected and just does its thing. We know   it sits there because we can see a number of stars 
being thrown around by a seemingly empty spot.   And despite its incredible 
mass, it’s radius is still   only 17 times our sun. Smaller than most giant 
stars, but millions of times more massive. Because Supermassive black holes are so 
massive and located at the center of galaxies,   many people imagine them as being a bit like 
the Sun in the solar system. An anchor that   glues everything else together and forces it into 
an orbit. But this is a misconception. While the   sun makes up 99.86% of all the mass in the solar 
system, SuperMassive Black Holes usually only have   0.001% of the mass of their galaxy. The billions 
of stars in galaxies are not gravitationally   bound to them, instead it is the gravitational 
effect of dark matter which holds them together. Many supermassive black holes aren’t gentle 
giants, especially when they are feeding on   the clouds of mass in their galaxy. The one at the 
center of the BL Lacertae galaxy is devouring so   much material that it produces jets of plasma 
accelerated to nearly the speed of light.   If Earth were orbiting this huge body, it would 
seem 115 times larger than our Sun in the sky…   and we’d be burnt to a crisp in seconds 
by its glowing hot accretion disk. At this point black holes become so large that 
stars seem ridiculously tiny compared to them. The galaxy Cygnus A has a super massive black hole 
with 2.5 billion solar masses and 14.7 billion km   wide, which would mean that if it took the place 
of our Sun, it would swallow all the planets and   stretch halfway to the edge of our Solar System. 
It is devouring so much mass and material that it   churns its disk into a kind of magnetic funnel, 
spewing gas out making tremendous radio lobes,   towering over the galaxy, half a million light 
years in diameter. That is 2.5 Milkyways wide. Another pretty large Super Massive Black 
hole sits in the galaxy Messier 87. It   has 6.5 billion solar masses and was the 
first black hole we got an actual photo of.   Or rather of the glowing gas around 
the edge of a menacing shadow.   This sphere of darkness is so large 
that it covers our entire Solar System. And yet, there is a scale even 
above these kinds of objects... Ultramassive black holes Now we reach the most massive black holes, perhaps 
the largest single bodies that will ever exist.   These black holes have eaten so much that they've 
grown to tens of billions of solar masses, their   gravity the engine for a ‘quasar’- an accretion 
disk shining brighter than thousands of galaxies   full of stars. So massive that they deserve a 
title of their own - Ultramassive Black Holes. The Ultra Massive Black Hole at the center of 
galaxy OJ 287 is 18 billion solar masses. It   is so big that it has a Super Massive black hole, 
nearly forty times larger than sagittarius A star,   orbiting it! This thing defies imagination 
and is really hard to compare to anything.   It can comfortably fit three Solar 
Systems side by side inside of it. Let us end this insane competition 
and get to the king of kings. TON 618, a black hole that we can observe 
consuming galaxies worth of matter is   shining with the brightness of a hundred trillion 
stars, visible from 18 billion light years away.   It has an incredible 66 billion solar masses. 
A black hole so large that it would take light   a week to reach the singularity after 
crossing the event horizon. About 11   Solar Systems could sit inside of it side 
by side. It may very well be the largest   single body in the universe. But in 
reality, it is probably even larger.   Since TON 618 is so far away, we only see 
what it looked like 10 billion years ago. In any case, black holes are scary and mysterious   and gigantic. They will be here after everything 
else dies, and growing larger and larger. So now let us do the trip again. From 
the smallest possible black hole,   all the way up to the largest. Let’s try something new today, 
we can call it: “Behind the Lies”   a short behind the scenes bit about the 
necessary inaccuracies in this video   because it's really not actually possible 
to rank black holes like trading cards. How so? Well, while we have catalogued 
millions of stars, we really only have   good data on a couple of dozen black holes. 
That’s because black hole gazing wasn’t really   a thing until 50 years ago – and technically 
still isn’t, because we can’t see black holes. We can only derive their properties from studying 
their gravitational effects on the matter around   them, like the orbit of stars that come close 
to them. This effect depends on the mass of the   black hole, which we can approximate at 
the most basic level with Kepler’s Laws.   But this comes with huge 
uncertainties and error bars.   Then we have to convert mass to size 
next, which brings new uncertainties.   For example, we calculated the radius from the 
mass using the Schwarzschild equation which for   the sake of simplicity assumes black holes are 
perfectly round and don’t spin: a kind of black   hole that doesn’t really exist. The reality is 
that physics on these scales is a bit fuzzy. So some of the black holes we talked about 
here may be way smaller or way bigger. We   just don’t know for sure. We shimmied around 
this problem by comparing different sources   with different kinds of values and using 
different mass calculations to arrive   at a standardized list that allowed us 
to be as accurate as humanly possible.   You can look at all of this in our source doc. As 
a result this script was written with the tears of   experts we drove crazy with our obsession 
for the best values they could live with. In this process, tons of stuff 
got cut and didn’t make it into   the final video – but luckily we 
found a way to not waste all of it: We created a lot of black hole merch, spanning the 
whole range from somewhat bonkers to more serious.   This way we get to explore a topic 
from different angles – and you   get to continue having fun with 
black holes after this video ends."
G-WO-z-QuWI,2021-07-06T14:00:16.000000,How To Terraform Venus (Quickly),"Leaving earth to find new homes in space is
an old dream of humanity and will sooner or later be necessary for our survival. The planet
that gets the most attention is Mars, a small, toxic and energy poor planet that just about
seems good enough for a colony of depressed humans huddled in underground cities. But what if we think bigger? What if we take
Venus, one of the most hostile and deadly places in the solar system and turn IT into
a colony? Not by building lofty cloud cities, but by creating a proper second earth? It
might be easier than you think. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the
solar system with a surface temperature of 460°C, hot enough to melt lead. This heat
is due to the most extreme greenhouse effect in the solar system. CO2 is great at trapping
heat – even a rise from 0.03% to 0.04% in Earth's atmosphere is heating up our planet
right now. Venus's atmosphere is 97% CO2. Also, Venus's atmosphere is 93 times denser
than earth’s. Standing on Venus’ surface would feel like taking a dive about 900 meters
deep into the ocean. The pressure would kill you instantly. It’s a truly horrible place! So why should
we even bother? First and foremost, Venus is almost as big
as Earth and has 90% of its surface gravity. Surface gravity is a big problem when colonizing
the solar system because it is very likely that long stays in low gravity places will
have negative health effects. Venus’ size means it could be the second
largest habitat in the solar system. A new home for billions of humans and trillions
of animals. With oceans, lush forests and a beautiful blue sky. A properly terraformed
Venus may be the most pleasant place to live outside of Earth. While we can’t exactly terraform Venus today,
a slightly more ambitious future version of us COULD take this project on. It will take
a few generations to complete and be a huge challenge – like building the great pyramids
was for our ancestors. But then it’s not like humans have never started projects that
took more than a lifetime to complete. Ok! Let’s do it! Before anything else, we need to cool Venus
down and remove the gas that makes up the extremely heavy atmosphere. As mentioned,
there is a lot of it. Around 465 million billion tons. How do we do that? There are a few options.
We could create giant solar collectors powering a huge array of laser beams, that heat up
the atmosphere so much that it is blasted into space. Although we would need thousands
of times the entire power generating capacity of humanity and it would still take thousands
of years to remove the atmosphere. Another way is to sequester the atmosphere.
Binding the CO2 in different compounds through chemical reactions. We could mine elements
like Calcium or Magnesium on Mercury and shoot them at Venus via mass driver systems – Electric
rails that make rockets unnecessary on smaller planets. The metals would combine to bind
the CO2 into different carbonates basically forever. But the scale makes the whole thing
impractical. We would need several hundred billion tons of material to sequester the
CO2 this way. Seems like a waste of material and might take too long. An equally ridiculous idea that could actually
work is to put Venus in the shade. Literally. By constructing a huge mirror to blot out
the sun to just freeze the atmosphere. The mirror does not need to be complex or massive,
just a very thin foil with a little structural support. Building such a large flat surface
so close to the sun will turn it effectively into a solar sail and push it out of position,
so instead of one giant circular object, our mirror will consist of many different pieces. Annular slats of angled mirrors can reflect
sunlight from one set of mirrors to the next. Mirrors would be angled, reflecting light
from one to another until the light is redirected to the back - balancing the force on the front
and holding them in position. After a few years of getting the infrastructure
in place, things start slowly and then escalate. For the first few decades, the atmosphere
slowly cools down but stays dense and deadly. Until, after some 60 years it reaches the
critical temperature of 31° Celsius. Suddenly, the Great Flood begins on Venus, as CO2 turns
to liquid at this pressure and begins to rain down- a constant global rainstorm of unbelievable
proportions lasting 30 years. The pressure and temperature suddenly begin to drop in
unison. For almost a century, puddles turn into lakes and oceans. The surface temperature is now -56° Celsius
and the pressure has dropped to only seven times the pressure on earth. Finally, at a
really unpleasant -81°, the CO2 oceans begin to freeze and the rain turns into snow. This
leaves us with a frozen Venus covered in oceans as hard as rock and gigantic CO2 glaciers.
What remains of the atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, at about 3 times earth’s surface pressure.
If you don’t mind freezing and suffocating, you can now take a stroll over Venus' surface. But the frozen CO2 remains a bit of a problem.
At some point we want to warm up the planet, but if we do, the CO2 ice will melt and fill
up the atmosphere again. So we need some way to keep it from doing
that. One is to simply cover it all with cheap plastic
insulation and cover it up with ground-up venus rock or water oceans. Although some
planetary scientists will be very stressed out about us building a new planet containing
a potential timebomb like that. A few unfortunately timed volcanoes could melt a lot of CO2 at
once and ruin everything. Another obvious solution is to shoot it all
out into space and collect it into a small moon for storage and future use. We can make
this more efficient by using mass drivers instead of rockets, but moving all that mass
will still be a pretty intense challenge that will take some time to solve. Whatever we end up doing with the atmosphere,
to move forward we need water, which we could get from Ice-Moons. Europa, a moon of Jupiter,
has twice as much water as Earth’s oceans. Now catching a moon and transporting it through
the solar system is not exactly easy. So instead it might be easier to cut chunks
of ice off Europa with an army of construction drones and shoot them at Venus using more
of those mass drivers. Space tethers could save us a lot of effort and energy here – we
made a whole video explaining how they work, but in a nutshell, they are slings that can
take a payload on both ends. On Europa, they do most of the work needed
to catapult our ice to Venus. The ice hits the Venus tethers, which gently drop it into
the atmosphere, where it falls down as snow. In exchange, the Venus tethers get to catch
CO2 ice shot up from below and accelerate it into orbit.
We can remove excess nitrogen using this same method to further lower our atmospheric pressure. After a few decades or centuries, Venus would
be covered by a nice, shallow frozen ocean a few hundred meters deep. It would look extremely
different from today. A few continents and countless islands have formed. This is beginning
to look a bit like our planet! Now the last and most magnificent phase of
terraforming begins: Making the atmosphere breathable and adding life. First we need light though and we need to
heat the planet up again. A Venus day is 2802 hours long. More than 116 Earth days. So if
we just remove our giant mirror, we would grill half of our planet. Even without the
massive atmosphere, temperatures would reach unbearable levels. The simplest way to create
a day/night cycle and let some energy in again, is with another set of mirrors to illuminate
our continents and melt our water oceans. Which would let us completely control how
much energy we get and where it goes. The atmosphere is now mostly made up of nitrogen
and basically devoid of oxygen. So the first inhabitants will likely be trillions and trillions
of Cyanobacteria, which can get photosynthesising and release oxygen. We know that they can
quickly turn around the atmosphere of a planet because billions of years ago, they were probably
responsible for turning the toxic atmosphere of our young Earth into an atmosphere with
enough oxygen for more complex animal life. But not only that – Cyanobacteria can fix
Nitrogen from the atmosphere and turn it into nutrients that can be used by living beings.
This way they will essentially fertilize our dead ocean water and prepare it for more complex
organisms. On land, our colonists need to grind down
some of the former venusian surface to make soil for nitrogen fixing plants to grow on.
Eventually billions of trees would spread creating large forests, covering massive parts
of the continents. Venus would turn green. First the oceans, then the land. To speed
things up, CO2 would be strategically released to supply the plants and cyanobacteria. Areas
already covered with plants could get extra daylight from our orbital mirrors, so the
plants would be active for most of each day. Maybe, we won’t have to do this with the
same plants and animals we know today. As genetic engineering matures and our understanding
of genetics and the machinery of life expands, we might just engineer life as we need it. All in all, it would take several thousand
years to make the atmosphere breathable by humans. In the meantime, you could stroll
around with nothing more than regular clothes and an oxygen mask. Settlers would enjoy a
vast new planet, filled with resources and bathed in sunlight. They might think of new
ways to use the vast amounts of carbon dioxide ice and nitrogen orbiting in space above.
Industrial processes, rocket fuel or even boosting the terraforming of another planet,
like tiny Mars Venus is fully terraformed. Animals roam through
vast ecosystems. Cities are being constructed. Billions of settlers and their descendants
make this world their home. They will see images of the past. How Venus was once the
most hostile planet around. How it took hundreds of years to freeze hell and to ship in the
oceans and another few thousand years to make it possible to breathe freely. They will barely
be able to believe it. Ok. Maybe it is not that easy to terraform
Venus and a lot of things must go right for this future to become reality. But it is possible
and with technology that is within the reach of a motivated and slightly more advanced
humanity that wants to venture into space. The only thing that is stopping it is our
imagination. And that at least is a problem"
dFCbJmgeHmA,2021-06-15T14:09:03.000000,The Day the Dinosaurs Died – Minute by Minute,"one of the greatest Illusions in life is continuity 66 million years ago the continuity of the dinosaurs had been going on for around 165 million years already and it didn't seem this would change anytime soon the world was warm and pleasant and most of the land was covered with Lush forests and an incredible diversity of trees flowers Ferns and trillions of Critters dinosaurs were ubiquity and had Diversified into hundreds of species of all shapes and sizes titanor large gentle Giants shared the world with famous beasts like Tyrannosaurus rex or Edmontosaurus pectinodon hunted in the undergrowth while Edmontosaurus wandered coastlines and swamps an ancient Paradise a world of planty Full of Life 66 million years ago May on a Tuesday afternoon life was the same as it had been the day before or a thousand years before or pretty much a million years before things were good for Our Feathered dinosaur buddies until a tiny tiny detail in the sky [Music] changed if there were dinosaurs watching the Stars one night they may have noticed the appearance of a new star a tiny dot that for many weeks slowly became bigger and brighter until one fateful day it looked like another small moon in the night sky and then it faded from sight as it dipped into Earth's Shadow for a few more hours the illusion of continuity was upheld until it was not anymore in the morning the object suddenly appears again now almost as large as the sun in the sky and growing every moment heading for the coast near the yakatan peninsula it takes the asteroid only seconds to pass through the thin layer between space and the ground to make contact as it enters the atmosphere at almost 60 times the speed of sound let's stop time here we see the unnamed asteroid about to commit species side larger than Mount aest it reaches from the ocean High into the atmosphere High than passenger planes would fly millions of years later at this moment the world was one way in a fraction of a second it would be fundamentally different let's make the transition as the asteroid hits the shallow ocean and the Bedrock below the energy of billions of nuclear weapons is released all at once as the asteroid vaporizes a flash of light illuminates the sky as an eerie bright white sphere grows over the Gulf of Mexico Bedrock melts into seething hot plasma at tens of thousands of De C the thermal radiation from the explosion travels at the speed of light and immediately Burns everything within a radius of about 1,500 km while the energy from the impact pushes so hard against Earth's crust that it loses all strength and flows away from the impact site like a liquid creating a hole 25 km deep and 100 km wide the o is pushed back for hundreds of kilom like when a kit jumps into a puddle as the crust bounces back melted and flowing crust forms a temporary Mountain stretching 10 km into the sky an incredible amount of material is blasted into the higher atmosphere or even out into space as much as 60 times the original mass of the asteroid the violence of the strike is felt everywhere on Earth within minutes a magnitude 11 earthquake maybe the most powerful Quake any living thing has ever witnessed in billions of years it is so insanely strong that in India it might have shaken gigantic lava fields and causes volcanic eruptions that would last for 30,000 years and cover half of the Indian subcontinent with lava even on the side of Earth opposite the impact the ground still moved by several meters nobody would sleep through this day the gigantic EXP explosion crashes against the atmosphere with unprecedented violence and causes a shock wave that reaches speeds of more than 1,000 km per hour near the sight of impact similar to the hyper hurricanes on gas giants like Neptune in Middle America basically any soil vegetation or animal is just shredded into pieces and catapulted thousands of kilometers away now the previously displaced oceans return as the temporary Mountain at the sight of impact collapses a ring of tsunami is as high as 1 km enough to cover all skyscrapers humans would ever build heads in all directions as they crash into the coasts of the continents surrounding the impact they will drown thousands of kilometers of Coastline 15 hours later some of the waves that get refracted around South America will still Tower as much as 100 m into the sky but we still haven't talked about the worst thing yet a lot of the debris yeeted into space will orbit Earth for thousands of years some may hit the moon or even Mars but most of it comes right back when Things fall through the atmosphere at such speeds they get very hot as in hundreds of degrees hot and this happens to millions of tons of material everywhere this rapidly heats up the atmosphere to insane temperatures we don't know exactly how hot it got or how long this heat shock lasted but there are two ideas here either the air was heated to hundreds of De for a few minutes or 2,000s of De for around 1 minute in any case the air became as hot as the inside of an industrial oven how bad the global effects of this were is contested but if enough heat reached the surface a lot of plants and animals would have died very quickly if they couldn't bury themselves or Escape into caves the heat together with raining debris Also may have ignited material on Forest floors and sparked wildfires as the Earth rotated under the Searing hot blue in a few hours massive wildfires were probably burning around the globe some of them may have lasted for months and turned Earth into a horrifying hot hellish version of itself as the day of the impact draws to an end many of the dinosaurs are already dead but the worst is still to come the gigantic plume of vaporized material reaches the upper atmosphere and spreads around the whole globe together with the S from the burning planet and the aerosol generated at impact the planet sinks into a deep Darkness with only the remaining raging fires Illuminating the scenery whatever plants survive the firestorms will now be starved for sunlight AS Global photosynthesis is temporarily shut down within days temperatures crash as much as 25° C the oceans were especially hard hit the lack of sunlight killed over 90% of Plankton which formed the basis of the food food web of marine life ultimately this would kill off the large marine reptiles and ammonites that used to dominate The Seas the biosphere the survivors Now find themselves in is like an alien landscape Ash debris and the burned remains of the formerly Lush and blooming life cover the ground the sky is dark and it's cold and fresh food is scarce while fungi Thrive for months and years the planet will be a hostile and deadly place the sudden Global Winter will last for decades at least 75% of all species on Earth will just vanish from existence and so as the day ends the world is suddenly different the continuity that went on for millions of years is no more the era of the dinosaurs is over just like that eventually From the Ashes of the old world survivors emerged birds that are the direct descendants of the dinosaurs and mammals that would eventually become the dominant animals on the planet without the asteroid who knows what life on Earth would look like today without the sudden disruption of dinosaur continuity that completely changed the planet and all life on it we might have never had the opportunity to become what we are today it's not clear how long the human era will last so so far modern humans have been around for 0.1% of the time the dinosaurs were and in this short amount of time we've achieved impressive Feats from making the world our own to reaching space and splitting the atom yet our future and our long-term survival are not a given if we're not careful it could end in an instant like the age of the dinosaurs end it but in contrast to them we know that our continuity is fragile even if it doesn't feel like it we can be prepared and be vigilant and hopeful if we're lucky our journey will go on for a long long time speaking of Journeys we want to address something in the spirit of transparency kazak has changed in the last 2 years we've become more than a YouTube channel or Animation studio and now also run a paper shop that sells hundreds of thousands of calendars posters and notebooks that's not a happy accident many of us have a background in graphic design paper products are Our Roots and we actually started out creating posters books and print infographics we love that you can touch them smell them nerd about small details and printing techniques just like the channel we started small and without great ambition step by step we found the right printers and papers learned about shipping and expanded our shop we put a huge amount of research love and hours into it because this is the only way we know how to do things we don't just want to make generic merch we want to make things that fit our mission of making science exciting and creating beautiful things things that persist and are made with high quality and love our shop gives us another Outlet to do this and as a nice side effect has turned into our main source of income for everything we do on this channel which also Keeps Us independent and our videos free for everyone so we want to build further on that and create more things that last we've just started a new notebook line called pocket log that will expand on in the future the first edition is a dinosaur themed collection that will hopefully serve a future paleontologist well there are loads of plans for sciency stuff more journals and calendars and infographics let us know what you would like us to make for your R Kids classrooms and yourself in the end the things we do work because you like them and because you enable us to put thousands of hours into

are a million distractions your family friends and romantic Partners boring work and exciting projects video games to play and books to read and then there's your couch that somebody needs to lie on it's easy to get lost so let's take a step back and look at your life from the [Music] outside the average ksar viewer is around 25 years old which is a pretty good time in the life of most people the insecurities of the teenage years have begun to recede Maybe you find yourself in a job or a long-term relationship maybe you've started a family or are working on an advanced degree maybe you're not doing any of that and still want to enjoy life whatever that means to you or maybe you feel stuck and don't know where to go yet about 1 in 20 people watching this video will get to live to 100 let's assume you are one of the lucky ones which means you had a total of 5,200 weeks of Life at your disposal when you were born you spent the first 600 weeks of your life being a kid and 400 being a teenager during this time you were pretty useless for Society and also not very free to make your own decisions as a payoff you were somewhat spared from the consequences and responsibilities of adulthood mostly because well-meaning adults protected You by cleaning up your mess and giving you time to find yourself this time is necessary to make you at least in theory a functioning human although most people probably don't feel like that after puberty in any case by the time you're 20 over 1,000 of your 5,200 weeks have passed depending on what you aspire to at this point you're either working already or have entered further education the amount of fun you can have in this phase of your life varies a lot if you pick up a trade or lead to work to support yourself or others the serious side of life begins earlier if you go to university you get to push back work life a bit longer in any case most people start working for real in their 20s at the latest which Begins the productive or potentially grindy or Soul crushing period of your life people tend to work until the age of 65 which means that you'll spend at least 2,000 weeks of your life with serious adult work hopefully in a job that makes you feel good and appreciated or that makes the world better this is such an important thing that we'll look at work and how you can try to find a satisfying career in another video this is the main block of life for most people the time when you might have kids and travel a bit and climb the career ladder and build a house may get divorced and fall in love again in this phase you transition from being young to middle-aged to Old not old old but the young old of your 60s at 65 you've used up 3,400 of your 5,200 weeks the last phase of your life begins if you've managed to acquire enough wealth to high in theory you're now free to do whatever you like for up to 1,800 weeks but of course this is not how it works for the majority of you watching this video 19 out of 20 people will not live to 100 the average lifespan in the US is 79 in Germany it's 81 in Japan 84 in Brazil it's 75 if you die at age 80 which is still not bad you only have 780 weeks of Freedom after you retire that's roughly as many weeks of Freedom as an old person as you spent as a child unfortunately disease and the tiredness of age trip you up here because with old age the human body begins to decline sharply for example the vast majority of cancer related deaths occur in people over 70 if you bet all your Fun Cards on being free and happy in your retirement you might be bitterly disappointed and all of this is still assuming things work out and and you even get to grow old you can drown in a pool at age 7 get cancer at age 32 die in a car crash at age 48 you can fall from a ladder at age 60 every day the universe rolls a bunch of dice for every human and every day someone somewhere on this planet rolls a critical failure and their life ends that day the older you get the more dice are rolled for you usually when you swim through the ocean that is your life you don't think about all of this too much and that's fine life is engaging Enough by itself and the future is this undefined weird thing but thinking about it from time to time is helpful in refocusing on what you want to do and to minimize regrets you will have when you look back and to remind you that if you don't use your time today you might not get a chance to use it tomorrow life is complicated and it's hard to make decisions between all the things and people that are important to you this has become painfully obvious to billions of people during the Corona virus pandemic if you respected social distancing so many things that we took for granted were not available anymore traveling and public places and eating out and seeing friends and meeting new people spending time together became limited and precious but actually the time you have with the people you love is already precious think of your parents as a child you spend basically every day with them your your time spent together begins to decline as you transition and become a teenager and fight to develop your own identity but as teenagers you probably still see them regularly which changes as you enter your 20s when most people move out for University for work or just to be on their own if you're making an effort to be with your parents for two full weeks each year for the rest of their lives which covers the main holidays birthdays and a bit extra you still have already spent more than 90% of the time you will ever spend with them even if they grow pretty old if they die earlier or if you see them only a few days each year this number shrinks even more so in all likelihood the vast majority of time you will ever spend with your parents has passed the same holds true for your siblings or old friends that moved to the other side of the country you're at the tail end of the time with some of the most important people in your life one day you will see them for the last time and it's actually the same with everything else the concept of doing something for the last time feels Eerie like something that you should only experience when you're on death row or extremely old or something like that but it happens all the time is there a Hobby you've been lazy about for a long time maybe you still have those Warhammer Minis that you wanted to paint did you always want to revisit that place where you had an amazing time a decade ago is there someone you wanted to reach out to for a long time but haven't yet or or pick up that sport again to meet new friends maybe you will never do any of these things again because life gets in the way and at some point it's too late as the global pandemic begins to wind down we will all soon be able to be with each other again and do fun things together it's never a bad time to reach out to a friend or a potential friend and let them know that you're looking forward to hanging out but no matter when you're watching this our life is an Incredible Gift and there are so many fun engaging and fulfilling things to do and you get to decide what and who matters

try it turns out there are even with sci-fi technology we are trapped in a limited pocket of the universe and the finite stuff within it how much universe is there for us and how far can we [Music] go if you look at the night sky you might assume it will be there forever stars born and die again in a cycle that feels endless but it's not take the Milky Way up to 200,000 light years in diameter containing some 100 to 400 billion stars how many stars do you think are born here each year thousands millions the answer is around three three new stars per year 95% of all the stars that will ever exist in the universe have already been born and we live at The Tail End of the Age of star formation we are at the beginning of the end of the universe as we know it the formation of new stars will continue to slow down but there's more it turns out that the universe is rushing away from us the Milky Way Is Not Alone Together with the Andromeda galaxy and more than 50 dwarf galaxies it forms the local group a region of space about 10 million light years in diameter our Galactic neighborhood hundreds of Galaxy groups like The Local group make up the lanaka supercluster which itself is only one of a myriad of superclusters in total there are around 2 trillion galaxies that make up the current observable universe unfortunately even if we could travel at light speed around 94% of the galaxies we can see are already unridable for us forever let this number sink in for a moment the simple fact that there's a limit for us and that there is so much universe that a human will never be able to touch is kind of frightening why are all of these galaxies Out Of Reach already well it all has to do with why there are galaxies in the first place the Big Bang we're simplifying here but in a nutshell about 10 the^ ofus 36 seconds after the big bang the young universe was a very small bubble of energy it wasn't completely uniform though some parts of it were a tiny tiny bit denser than others which had massive consequences in a process called Cosmic inflation the observable universe expanded rapidly from the size of a marble to trillions of kilometers in a trillionth of a second that was so fast that all those tiny differences in density were stretched from subatomic distances into Galactic distances which is why the whole universe consists of more and less dense regions pockets of the universe filled with a bit more stuff than the space around them after that short but powerful inflation ended gravity began trying to pull everything back together inside the denser Pockets gravity emerged Victorious and so over time they grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in today the local group is our pocket of the universe but at larger scales outside the denser pocket the expansion of space never stopped this means that our local group is surrounded by a lot of stuff but none of those structures and galaxies are gravitationally bound to us the more the universe expands the larger the distance between us and the other gravitational Pockets becomes even worse for us the expansion of the universe is accelerating we don't know why this happens so we came up with the concept of dark energy you can imagine it like an invisible effect that speeds up the expansion of the universe we'll explain these Concepts in more detail in another video though for now all you need to know is that the universe is expanding faster and faster this expansion means that there's a cosmological horizon around us everything Beyond it is traveling faster relative to us than the speed of light so everything that passes The Horizon is irretrievably Out Of Reach forever and we will never be able to interact with it again in a sense it's like a black hole's Event Horizon but all around us 94% of the galaxies we can see today have already pass it and are lost to us forever wait if we can't interact with them how come we can still see them well the way we're able to see something is via light and although the speed of light is the fastest way to travel through the universe it needs time to get from one place to another every second Light reaches us from trillions of galaxies that have passed the Horizon because when their light was emitted they were much closer to us we are looking at their ancient past and see their ancient positions so the observable universe is much larger than the universe we can actually interact with in a sense the universe is pulling off a great show for us showing us things that are Out Of Reach forever we have no idea what these galaxies look like today and we will never know but we will be able to observe them for a long time as their light H our telescopes interestingly this means that currently the observable universe still appears to be growing as more and more Light released by super distant galaxies billions of years ago is arriving at our doorsteps still all the pockets of the universe outside the local group will one day pass our cosmological Horizon once they do their light won't be able to reach us anymore and from our perspective they will fade away Into Darkness every second of your life 60,000 Stars pass the Horizon since you started watching this video around 22 million stars have moved out of our reach forever okay but if 94% of the observable universe is beyond the cosmic Horizon and gone forever that still leaves us with 6% that is technically in reach which is still a ton of stuff all the Galaxy Pockets that are less than 18 billion light years away they are still moving away but slow enough that we could physically reach them although the chances are shrinking with every second that passes everything that's more than around 5 million light years away is moving away from us but the closest galaxy groups are receding the slowest so there is a Time window to jump Galaxy groups the challenge is Extreme though even for type three civilizations even at the speed of light a trip to the Mafi group the closest pocket of galaxies outside the local group would take 11 million years if some sort of super motivated super Advanced civilization takes this Challenge on its potential sphere of influence could expand to hundreds or thousands of galaxies although as time passes and the universe grows they would be separated forever it's pretty safe to assume that humans will not make this journey at least not with technologies that are even remotely on the horizon for us the local group is most likely the largest structure that we will ever be a part of just traveling between the Stars would be an achievement of Epic Proportions we would already be incredibly successful if we were to colonize our Cosmic backyard which accounts for 0.000000 00000000000000 1% of the observable universe as dark energy pushes the rest of the universe away from us the local group will become more tightly bound all its galaxies big and small will merge together to form one giant elliptical galaxy with the unoriginal name mil dromeda in a few billion years this process might even smash huge gas clouds together and respark star formation for some time and this new light will be very welcome because at some point the Galaxy's outside milk dromeda will be so far away that they become too faint to detect once this happens no information outside of the local group will reach us ever again the universe will recede from view a being born in the far future in mil dromeda will think that the Universe consists of nothing but its own Galaxy when they look far into empty space they will only see more emptiness and darkness they won't see cosmic background radiation and they won't be able to learn about the Big Bang they may have no way of knowing what we know today the nature of the expanding Universe when it began and how it will end they might think the universe is static and eternal milk dromeda will be an island in the darkness slowly getting darker and darker still with its trillion Stars the local group is certainly a big enough playground to entertain Humanity for a while after all we still haven't figured out how to leave our solar system and we have dozens of billions of years at the very least to explore our galaxy and we have the incredible luck to exist at the perfect moment in time to see not only our future but also our most distant past just by looking into the night sky as isolated as the local group is it is our home and it really is a spectacular Place time for some behind the scenes content you might have noticed that we sorta already made this video a few years ago but the original had a regrettable mistake in it we said it would be physically impossible to ever leave the local group to reach other Galaxy groups but our travel limit is actually much larger as we showed in this video it's not physically impossible to go further but just extremely unlikely that it'll ever happen so why did we leave the video up well it has to do with the nature of the mistake we talked to astrophysicists and they thought it didn't matter the parts they considered important were correct and they thought we should just leave it and move on so with that feedback we decided to spare the video but since 2016 and ready thanks to you BS we were able to grow ksar and add fact Checkers to the team and develop an in-depth process with experts and our detailed sources documents to avoid these sorts of mistakes and also to make our work transparent we can't avoid making mistakes from time to time but we can work hard on getting better and this video kept bugging us so we finally decided to replace it not just re-upload but remake it better and longer and add fun universe facts to make it worthwhile sorry for taking so long we'll leave the old video up but p a comment and change the title if you want to support us and our sometimes exhausting but hopefully worthwhile methods you can watch share and

QqsLTNkzvaY,2021-04-27T13:59:20.000000,What If You Fall into a Black Hole?,"black holes are the most powerful and extreme things in the universe and they're wildly weird and complicated what would happen if you fell inside one and what are they [Music] really first we need to talk about space and time space and time are the grand stage where the play of the universe unfolds but space isn't a fixed stage and time doesn't tick the same for everyone everywhere in short they're relative matter bends space and bent space tells matter how to move put some stars and planets on the stage and it sacks underneath them that misshapen stage with all its little warps and dips gives us gravity black holes do not just bend the stage they're like trap doors places with so much mass that the Universe formed a noggo Zone where the rules change most black holes form when very massive stars die we explained this process in detail in our neutron star video all you need to know now is that in the final moments of really massive stars their insides implode at nearly a quarter of the speed of light this packs so much mass so close together creating something so dense that it's sort of breaks the stage of the universe a black hole with 10 times the mass of the Sun would be barely 60 km across if you look directly at a black hole it looks like nothing the space under their control is blocked by an invisible oneway border called The Event Horizon The Event Horizon forms a shell around a region of space that once entered is shielded from the rest of the universe forever because the black hole trapo form space so much not even light can escape it and with nothing escaping to transfer information from the inside it's impossible to tell what it really looks like we can still observe black holes because of their effect on matter things can orbit black holes just as they can orbit the Sun or a planet many black holes have discs of matter orbiting outside the Event Horizon this matter can become incredibly hot as close orbits can speed this matter up to half the speed of light and tiny amounts of friction and collisions between particles heat them to a billion deg making the space around these black holes ironically incredibly bright what would happen if you were to try to get close or even inside a black hole first of all you'd see the strangest funhouse mirror in the universe mattera isn't the only thing orbiting a black hole gravity is so strong near them that light can orbit too if you hover just outside the event vent Horizon at the photon sphere in any direction you just see yourself Straight Ahead would be the back of your own head as light from your back travels around the black hole to your eyes gravity also Alters the passage of time itself the stronger the gravity the slower time passes while you watch the universe above you speed up those far away will watch you in slow motion if you chose to fly away from the black hole you might find that eons have passed for the rest of the universe a freakish one-way time travel trip to the Future where your loved ones are long dead but getting close to a black hole can be incredibly dangerous a painful death by spaghettification awaits you because your feet are closer to the black hole than your head they feel a stronger pull of gravity enough to pull you apart as you descend it gets worse the pulling gets stronger your body squeezed thinner and straighter until you've been reduced to a thin stream of hot plasma gobbled up in one final slurp never to be seen again spaghettification is only a risk with smaller black holes since they have much smaller radi ey if you go to the center of a galaxy and find a super massive black hole you might be able to experience crossing the Event Horizon as you approach The Event Horizon a distant Observer would think they never saw you enter it seeing you stop and fade the last Light you emit trickling up and out away from the event vent Horizon meanwhile from your perspective the void of the black hole Rises up to meet you as lights from fewer directions can reach you the Blackness envelops you until your only view of the universe you left is a tiny spot of light here inside the Event Horizon space and time are so horribly broken the real time travel is possible so it's probably a good thing that nothing gets out if anything could Escape it could create all sorts of time travel paradoxes and issues that break the universe as scary as the Event Horizon is it keeps us safe from that drama whether you have survived this long doesn't really matter as now there's only the certainty of crushing death in your near future inside the Event Horizon SpaceTime itself is so bent and warped that whatever Direction you move here every forward you go leads only towards the center of the black hole trying to go in any direction only brings you to the center faster to survive the longest you must do nothing in the center of the black hole we find the singularity a single point with all the matter that has ever crossed the Event Horizon all crushed to a point infinitely small there is no memory of the things that made it as stuff disappears down the black hole trapo Forever The Singularity makes all things equal this actually breaks the universe in really cool ways we've made a video about this problem if you want to learn more but in a nutshell everything that comes too close becomes black hole matter concentrated at the singularity this lack of a memory of its past means that a black hole has only three properties its mass Spin and electric charge everything else is lost they're a lot like fundamental particles in that respect this actually means that every single black hole in the universe is the same sure their mass is different and some spin faster than others but if we were to put all the singularities into a magical physics Museum they'd be identical like electrons but just like fundamental particles the properties of singularities are the best ways we can describe them on paper rather than an accurate representation of reality our current theories about the universe namely general relativity are just not able to describe or explain them the curvature of space becomes infinite density becomes infinite and our rules just don't make sense The Singularity has no surface or size something like a divide by Z era in the universe so singularities might not even exist or be completely different things but this is all we know right now from the best prediction we have from our best current theory of SpaceTime also basically everything you've ever heard about black holes even in this video is about theoretical black holes that aren't spinning because their maths is so much much easier but since black holes were born from dying stars that were spinning extremely quickly in their final moments as far as we know all black holes in the universe should be spinning right now at incredible speeds too up to 90% of the speed of light this means that in reality black holes are even more screwed up than they usually get credit for the singularities of rotating black holes are even Wilder the rotation causes them to swell outwards into a sort of ring this rotation is so powerful that space itself is dragged along this creates another region around spinning black holes called the ergosphere where it's impossible to stay still no matter how hard you try like a rushing Whirlpool of SpaceTime The Tide Is irresistible and the black hole makes you orbited whether you want to or not okay so what will happen to black holes as the universe ages and dies around them again we don't know but we have some ideas based on our current understanding of physics Hawking radiation in Quantum field Theory the vacuum of space is boiling with Quantum fluctuations these fluctuations are creating matter and antimatter pairs of particles from nothing which only exist for a very short time before annihilating when this happens near the Event Horizon of a black hole one of these particles can fall in stopping them from annihilating the escaping particle is hawking radiation ultimately the mass of this particle must come from the black hole so over eons black holes will shrink and radiate away Hawking radiation is not the stuff that fell into the black hole it's new stuff stealing Mass from it as the black hole shrinks the Hawking radiation gets stronger faster and faster until what's left eventually evaporates in a flash of high energy radiation like a nuclear bomb and then nothing but that won't happen for a long long time a black hole with the mass of our sun has a lifetime of 10 to the power of 67 years which means that it would take 10,000 billion billion billion billion billion billion years to lose 0.00001% of its mass but most black holes are way more massive than our sun the most massive super massive black holes in the centers of galaxy have lifetimes of 10 to the power of 100 years how long is that imagine an hourglass filled with one grain of sand for every single particle in the universe every 10 billion years one single grain of sand falls to the bottom if we waited for all the sand to fall down not even 1% of the lifetimes of these black holes would have passed there is no good concept to help our brains grasp these time scales will we ever truly understand black holes really know what's going on inside them no one knows we can only see their outsides and the theories we have probably get their insides wrong but it's okay to not know everything it just means there's still work to be done it means there are still Mysteries to solve and Big Ideas to think about which is why humans do science in the end we can at least be sure that we still have plenty of time left to think about them before the last one melts away if you want to continue thinking about black holes you can do so by getting one of the many black hole related

EhAemz1v7dQ,2021-04-13T14:00:11.000000,Do we Need Nuclear Energy to Stop Climate Change?,do we need nuclear energy to stop climate change more and more voices from science environmental activists and the Press have been saying so in recent years but this comes as a shock to those who are fighting against nuclear energy and the problems that come with it so who's right well it's complicated to slow rapid climate change the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to Net Zero in 2018 3 of global emissions were released through energy production namely by burning fossil fuels energy is a broad term that describes all sorts of stuff from moving things and people around to putting things big and small together or heating our homes currently 84% of the world's primary energy comes from fossil fuels 33% from oil 27% from coal and 24% from gas around 10% of the global oil supply is just used to burn in boilers to make our homes cozy and warm only about 16% of global energy is from low emission sources almost 7% from hydroelectric 5% from solar wind bioenergy wave tidal and geothermal combined and about 4% from nuclear so we pretty much rely on coal oil and gas to keep our civilization going which means it's actually very hard to transition away from them to have a chance of escaping fossil fuels without throwing Humanity back into the Stone Age one of the most impactful things we can do is to Electrify as many sectors as possible electricity is the stuff that appears like magic when you plug something into a socket so you can watch YouTube Every industry that can switch from burning fossil fuels to electricity needs to do so from electric cars to electric heaters why do we need to bet so hard on electricity because we can prod produce electricity with low emission Technologies like solar wind or Nuclear So electricity is a real lever for a radical transition but there are a few problems making this transition really hard first of all in most places in the world electricity is still generated mostly by burning fossil fuels and not only that in the last 20 years the world's electricity usage increased 73% in absolute terms while we are installing Renewables at record speeds at the same time the amount of fossil fuel we're burning for electricity still keeps Rising year by year Renewables have so far not been able to catch up with the demand for new electricity and so despite our progress emissions from electricity are still Rising worldwide the other alternative to fossil fuels is nuclear and even though it's not renewable its greenhouse gas emissions are tiny compared to burning stuff but in the last 20 years nuclear has basically stagnated countries like China India and South Korea built new reactors while Germany and Japan have been actively taking their nuclear plants offline which seems a bit weird if we look at the countries with the most low carbon electricity in the world that get most of their juice mainly from two sources nuclear or hydrop power take France and Sweden in France only around 10% comes from fossil fuel fuels while 67% comes from nuclear and 23% from Renewables primarily Hydro in Sweden almost 30% comes from nuclear power and about 45% from Hydro so we know that nuclear energy can work at scale on the technical side because of the lack of investment and innovation in the last few decades the majority of the world's nuclear reactors are pretty old technology that's very costly to replace in most Western countries build in nuclear reactors has become very expensive for a variety of reasons like a loss of knoow in constructing them policy changes and increased regulatory constraints so it can take a decade or longer just to finish a power plant in contrast countries like South Korea China India and Russia are able to build new nuclear reactors comparatively quickly and at a competitive cost still generally in the west the current generation of nuclear power plants are more expensive to build and maintain than most most fossil fuel Alternatives there are also the concerns about nuclear waste and the fear of accidents but we cover those in other videos in more detail we have designs for nuclear reactors that solve many of their problems namely small reactors that take less time and money to get started there are also next Generation technologies that can already turn radioactive waste into new fuel but so far these have not been deployed at a scale where they can have a significant impact on the nuclear SE considering these uncertainties some argue that nuclear power is a dangerous relic of the past and that we should just let it go and focus on Renewables but while Renewables undoubtedly are the future of electricity they still have their own huge challenges to overcome before they can take over the vast majority of the electricity gr the main problem is reliability and consistency it's not always windy and the sun doesn't always shine especially in the morning and evenings when humans need the most electricity the variations between Seasons don't make this issue easier to make Renewables reliable and not risk blackouts we need massive storage capacities where we can save energy collected when the sun or wind are at their Peak and release it later when we actually need it until this is possible other sources of electricity need to provide a controllable load that creates the reliability of Supply that our civilization needs to run properly eventually we will be able to do this with Renewables but we need a lot of batteries or storage power plants right now we simply don't have the tech and the capacities to make this transition fast enough to replace fossil fuels but even if we could there's another aspect we have to take into account we're not just trying to kick fossil fuels out of electricity we're trying to replace energy with electricity if we're going to to Electrify sectors that currently use fossil fuels like cars or heating we will need significantly more electricity than we're currently using everywhere around the world and if the electricity needs of the world population continue to grow as they have over the last 20 years we'll need even more it all comes down to one thing no energy source is perfect all have their own unique problems both Renewables and nuclear energy require time investment and technological Innovation on their own neither is ready to remove fossil fuels from our electricity grit although activists on both sides claim that they are in the end the question is how we want to deal with all these challenges should we give up nuclear immediately and at least temporarily accept higher emissions will we try to extend the life of current nuclear reactors and shut them down afterwards while solving the shortcomings of Renewables or will we invest in new nuclear technology to get new nuclear reactor types that are cheaper and safer or will we maybe do both opinion part starts here considering the risks the climate change poses for the biosphere and Humanity any technology that has a chance of contributing to a solution should be pursued that's just good risk management and strategy if preventing rapid climate change as quickly as possible is our goal it might be a good idea to see nuclear and Renewables not as opponents but as partners we know there's no time to waste so we should keep all of our low emission players on the field as things are both nuclear and Renewables need Innovation and investment but if we don't know yet which technology will be ready how quickly why not just invest in both and see what happens and on the topic of current capacities if we take nuclear energy offline right now then that missing capacity will be replaced at least partially by fossil fuels even if new nuclear power plants in the west are expensive in the long run it may be cheaper to build them as long as they prevent more fossil fuel capacity being added and paying for the consequences of Rapid climate change so do we need nuclear energy well it really depends how hard we choose to make things for ourselves and in a world that's already having a really hard time quitting fossil fuels why why should we make things harder than necessary
VB_GWz25B3Q,2021-03-09T14:59:36.000000,What if the World turned to Gold? - The Gold Apocalypse,"here in the ksk Zar Labs we only work on the most important scientific problems like what if we nuke stuff or how about we make this elephant explode or who could forget look at this thing it's really big continuing this proud tradition let's explore the scientific mystery of what would happen to you if Earth suddenly turned into gold the Midas apocalypse based on the ancient tale of King Midas who was cursed so everything he touched turned into gold before we can explore this scenario with science we'll first Define the premise midas's curse is a very special phenomenon called Magic which allows us to modify physics so what happens when Midas touches something and it turns to [Music] gold an atom of gold has 79 protons and 118 neutrons in its nucleus the electric force of the protons on the electrons around them shapes the atom and gives gold its chemical properties like that it doesn't rust and that it's kind of shiny and bending so to make not gold into gold we have to change atoms let's say Midas touches a duck or the Light Elements like hydrogen carbon and oxygen gain electrons and protons and neutrons to become gold not only is the duck suddenly 33 times more massive it's also much too dense the gold atoms are far closer together than they like and repel each other violently causing the Golden Duck to explode with the energy of half a ton of TNT leaving only gold dust and a very dead Midas this is clearly not a very good way for midas's power to work so what if instead midas's power uses the atoms that are already present and simply rearranges all particles in the matter he touches into gold no matter is created or destroyed instead atoms dissolve and the protons neutrons and electrons are reassembled to make gold however gold is very dense about 20 times denser than a duck without adding any matter the gold duck would be a very awkward kind of foamy gold with lots of tiny microscopic gaps this is funky and doesn't explode which is progress now that we've established a sort of magic that works what would happen if Midas stumbles what if he touches Earth itself let let's freeze time for just a moment and rearrange all the matter in the earth just like the duck the Earth is now solid gold but with many tiny atomic scale gaps while these gaps weren't a huge deal for the duck they're a big problem for the earth a spongy planet is not a thing that can exist as gravity compresses Earth squeezing it together to close up the gaps as a result the Earth contracts shrinking to 2/3 of its radius if you're standing on Earth's surface you'll suddenly find yourself in freefall like on a roller coaster as the ground sinks away beneath you but since the ground is falling too it doesn't move away from you it feels like someone turned off gravity and you and everything else would begin to float but the ride doesn't last forever it takes only 10 minutes for everything to crash down and a weird 10 minutes it is indeed and then as abruptly as it started it stops the collapsing Earth has reached its desired size and gravity is suddenly turned back on for you hopefully you enjoyed your minutes of floating because the ground and you with it crash into the planet at 30,000 km an hour making your body splatter like a water balloon as it hits in one instant basically all of humanity gets smashed into red puddles this is only the start of our problems though since Earth imploded supersonically the kinetic energy of the implosion is basically equivalent to detonating a planet made of TNT crushed together under incredible forces Earth's core reaches a million de c a temperature closer to the core of a star than anything we're used to finding on Earth as the Earth crashes into itself it generates an enormously powerful shock wave which plows upwards catapulting the atmosphere up and off the Earth's surface temperature reaches hundreds of thousands of deg and everything on it is instantly vaporized to a fluffy plasma Cloud that starts to expand but not by much many of the atoms that may have been new get mixed into this Cloud While others boil off escaping from the atmosphere the golden plasma outshines the sun while the enormous radiation lifts tons of material off into space over the coming days the plasma Cloud cools and eventually freezes into a shiny Little Golden Ball okay maybe this type of magic doesn't work so if replacing atoms made the Earth so overdense that it exploded and disassembling and reassembling atoms made the Earth so underdense that it imploded there must be a sweet spot where the Earth does neither what if midas's power is such that an object is suddenly replaced by an object with the same volume made from solid gold that magic is a little bit more magic and cuts a few extra corners but let's see where this leads us so Midas stumbles again even though our new pure gold Earth is not expanding or Contracting it's suddenly much more massive the density of gold is 3 and 1/2 times greater than the earth meaning the Earth is going to get 3 and 1/2 times more massive for starters everyone now has to contend with surface gravity that is more than three times stronger so if you're not a champion weightlifter who's used to carrying around a few times your body weight on your shoulders you're probably going to be slammed To The Ground by your own weight depending on on where you were when Earth turned into gold this alone could seriously hurt or even kill you trees and artificial structures collapse under stress they were never meant to sustain while birds and PLS and all things that were able to fly or float Splash to the ground all around you and you're not the only thing weighed down by the greater Gravity the weight of the atmosphere and also atmospheric pressure nearly quadruples which is a bad thing if you like living on its own this won't kill you scuba divers can comfortably breathe air at the pressures for a while but unfortunately squeezing the atmosphere this much raises its temperature to 150° C which is like the insides of an oven the entire Earth surface bakes roasting anything and everything there is no Escape gold may be a metal but it's about three times weaker than steel and also very malleable which makes it very bad Mountain material the tallest mountains that can be supported are now only about 2 km high so whole ranges compress as they own weight basically crushes their base it's hard to say what happens here we're probably in for giant earthquakes and landslides as the planet is squeezed into a new shape and it's not just mountain ranges the differences between the continents and the ocean floor level out causing the ocean basins to overflow sending massive tidal waves over the Earth's surface what remains is a planet made of gold entirely covered by an ocean 3 km deep a super hot atmosphere and a lot of dead people H okay there may be a lesson to take away here but we're not sure what it is we did all the maths though it's in our sources document if you want to take a look if you learned anything in this video let us know what it was"
Jzfpyo-q-RM,2021-02-02T15:02:01.000000,Worst Nuclear Accidents in History,"nuclear energy creates an uneasy feeling of danger for many people ancient and dangerous minerals are concentrated to awaken seemingly unnatural Powers creating horribly toxic elements that if they escape can and have killed people in horrible ways how many people has nuclear energy killed and [Music] how nuclear energy has been a thing since 19 51 and since then there have been around 30 reported accidents globally most of them were pretty minor compared to the two disasters everybody is familiar with Fukushima and Chernobyl Chernobyl is undoubtedly the worst nuclear accident in history for a number of reasons the reactor technology was old and Ill prepared for emergencies and the government response was slow and more concerned about image than damage control still only 31 people died directly in the accident but what makes nuclear energy scary is not reactors blowing up but the radiation they release so the real question is how many deaths through cancer and other diseases will chernobil cause here things get really complicated because you dip right into controversy and just discussing the different estimates and how they were calculated deserves a video of its own the most pessimistic estimate comes from a study commissioned by the European green party and projects up to 60,000 premature deaths by the year 2065 most scientific studies come up with numbers much lower than this the wh has estimated that in total the long-term death toll will be around 4,000 while the UN scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation concluded that even this figure could be too high for more details on this check our research document the second big nuclear accident was Fukushima daichi in 2011 Fukushima did not only operate with much better technology that was less dangerous in the first place much better security measures were in place and the official response was fast and decisive and so the current death toll is only 573 the major difference here is that these deaths were not a consequence of radiation they were indirect deaths from the stress of the evacuation of the areas around the reactors and occurred almost entirely in older populations estimates of the possible long-term deaths from radiation vary WI from none at all to about 1,000 in terms of the other long-term consequences an increase in thyroid cancer in children has been observed but according to the who this is related to The increased screening rate by 2018 there had been only one confirmed death among workers as a result of radiation induced lung cancer now let's compare this to renewable energy solar wind and geothermal energy basically only cause deaths as a result of construction and maintenance accidents unfortunately their current share of global energy is pretty low the major player in renewable energy is hydrop power which mostly means building dams and letting water flow through turbines from a higher elevation to a lower elevation in total Hydro has been the most fatal in terms of accidents with hundreds of thousands of deaths in the last half century one accident clearly stands out the 1975 Banga hydroelectric Dam failure in China which has striking similarities to chobble Old technology poor design and poor management by authoritarian governments concerned about appearances in a nutshell a massive typhoon triggered intense flooding the destroyed the dam and subsequently a number of smaller dams in a chain reaction unleashing a flood of over 15 billion cubic M of water in total kilometer wide waves as high as buildings devastated thousands of square km of Countryside and countless communities all in all the death toll from just this one accident and its direct consequences is estimated to lie between 85,000 to 240,000 but all of these deaths caused by nuclear and renewable energy are actually negligible in comparison to the real killer energy source fossil fuel the most widely used source of energy and electricity when we burn fossil fuels to heat up water and make turbines spin or to cause mini explosions to move cars with internal combustion engines gases like ozone sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide are released into the atmosphere breathing in these gases disrupts lung function which aggravates chronic conditions like asthma and bronchitis and causes a wide range of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases but even more dangerous is the fine particle pollution burning fossil fuels causes a mixture of solid and liquid droplets of poisonous substances as small as 2.5 microns in diameter they easily find their way deep into your lungs and increase the risk of deadly diseases like lung cancer stroke and heart disease fossil fuel related air pollution is the number one cause of environmental related deaths in the world according to the who it accounts for 29% of all cases of lung cancer 177% of deaths from acute lower respiratory infection 24% from stroke 25% from ES schic heart disease and 43% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease all in all outside air pollution adds up to the deaths of 4 million people each year what makes air pollution especially problematic and Sinister is the fact that the damage it causes happens very gradually which makes it hard for our brains that didn't evolve with subtle dangers in mind to realize the scope of the problem collectively air pollution from fossil fuels is estimated to have have killed around 100 million people in the past 50 years but wait is that really fair fossil fuels also provide over 80% of global energy so it makes sense that they cause the most deaths so let's compare deaths per energy unit deaths per energy unit produced a few Studies have compared the death rates from different energy sources per 1 tatt hour that's about the annual energy consumption of 2017 ,000 EU citizens or 12,600 US citizens to produce that much energy for one year coal causes 25 deaths oil causes 18 and natural gas three renewable energy causes one death every few decades and nuclear in the worst case nuclear energy would cause one death every 14 years one study even found that nuclear energy actually saved 2 million lives between 1971 and 2009 but by displacing fossil fuels from the global Energy Mix the numbers are clear even when using wildly pessimistic numbers nuclear energy is among the safest forms of energy generation and at a time when we're struggling to slow down rapid climate change it's a really valuable low carbon option however all these facts still leave one major argument that is fielded against nuclear power opponents of nuclear energy argue that nuclear waste and its lack of long-term storage solutions is an unacceptable problem and risk while proponents of nuclear energy say that until renewable energies are able to cover the complete energy demands of mankind it's arguably safer to store nuclear waste for the time being than to inhale poisonous gases and promote rapid climate change but a detailed discussion about nuclear waste would go too far here more about it in our sources let us know if you'd like a whole video about it so looking at the comparative death rates it's a bit concerning that some countries are replacing nuclear energy with fossil fuels mostly coal especially Germany and Japan have been the most active in dismantling their nuclear Fleet in aoy to appease the public the German government shut down 11 of its 17 nuclear facilities and plans to close the remaining reactors in 2022 the immediate Gap in energy production was filled by temporarily increasing coal production the energy source with the largest Health impacts and the worst con quences for climate change a 2019 analysis concluded that as a consequence the nuclear phase out has led to 1,100 avoidable deaths per year in Germany due to the increased air pollution in the years after 2010 so in conclusion nuclear energy feels way more dangerous than it actually is no matter how you look at it the one thing we should strive to get rid of as quickly as possible of fossil fuels to prevent the deaths they cause each year and to slow down climate CL change regardless of how much you personally care about climate change issues or which energy source you favor saving millions of lives should be something we can all agree on"
qEfPBt9dU60,2020-12-15T14:59:51.000000,What if We Nuke the Moon?,what would happen if we were to detonate a very very powerful nuclear weapon on the moon would the explosion knock its orbit towards Earth causing tidal waves and misery could the moon be destroyed showering the Earth in a rain of meteoric [Music] death during the Cold War the moon was a major Target for space exploration and you know military bases so the US Air Force commissioned a serious study into the effects of a nuclear detonation on the surface of the Moon but just quoting stuff is boring so let's conduct a very important scientific experiment with an imaginary 100 Megaton thermonuclear Warhead about twice as powerful as the most powerful bomb ever detonated we'll also place a number of curious astronauts around the Moon as observers let's push the button and slow down time for the first few milliseconds nothing much happens outside our weapon meanwhile inside High explosives send a shock wave to a radioactive metal core compressing it so much that it reaches criticality and starts a nuclear fishing Chain Reaction the 100 million Dee plasma created in this first stage sets off the second stage with atomic nuclei fusing like they do in the core of a star very briefly our weapon contains one of the the hottest places in the universe and only now barely 10 milliseconds later does the rest of the universe find out that anything has happened as suddenly the bomb dissolves and a flaming star of nuclear death is born so far so good but everything that happens now is very different from what we're used to on Earth because of one major difference there's no atmosphere as the fireball shines it releases a flash of X-rays and thermal photons a wave of silent heat which rushes outwards in all directions on Earth this heat would Char and burn everything within a 50 km radius at least but on the moon without an atmosphere and oxygen rich air there's no burning at all also there are no things to burn the crunchy top soil of the moon is made from silicate Rock and metals chewed to dust by eons of meteorite impacts mixed with tiny traces of water when heated by the explosion x-rays from the fireball vaporize a thin cloud of Rock from the lunar surface while the Unlucky dust that's inside the fireball melts into glass any astronauts watching the show within about 50 km can expect to be fried and now we begin to see one of the biggest differences between explosions in space and on Earth on Earth the atmosphere fights back against the plasma bubble its expansion is violently stopped within Moments by the pressure of the atmosphere but this is not good news as the fireball Rams the atmosphere it it produces the most destructive part of a nuclear explosion on Earth the shock wave compressed air around the explosion rushes out faster than the speed of sound shattering buildings and roaring so loud it ruptures organs but on the moon there is no shock wave no atmosphere means nothing to impede the expanding explosion in space on the moon the fireball just grows in Airy silence as there's no atmosphere to stop it or to give it a voice this would be an amazing thing to watch from a safe distance unfortunately there's hardly any safe viewing distance for a nuclear explosion on the moon without an atmosphere weakening the deadly ionizing radiation that can scramble DNA anyone close enough to get a good look will be exposed to fatal amounts of radiation but of course that's not all while all of this happens the explosion hammers against the moon transferring about a tenth of the explosion energy into seismic waves powering an intense moonquake the Moon is much smaller than the Earth and our astronauts will feel an inescapable violent shaking no matter where they're standing comparable to an earthquake of seven on the r to scale this shaking could seriously damage or even level infrastructure we might have built anywhere on the moon those who hit on The Far Side of the Moon would have no idea it was an exposion the quaking would feel like an asteroid the size of the Great Pyramid had struck and it's not over yet where our bomb explodes the ground splatters like water when a rock strikes a pond as the explosion pushes against the surface it may excavate as much as 100 million cubic M of dust and rock forming a crater a km across while Bedrock is pulverized to Rubble debris is shot into the sky in every direction again without an atmosphere there's no drag to slow any of it down much of the debris scattered never returns to the Moon flying off faster than escape velocity a flurry of microm meteorites have been cast off to explore or the solar system many of which will rain down on the earth though few will be larger than Pebbles any satellite astronaut or space station in the way though will have a really bad time microm meteorites are launched at many speeds and angles allowing them to spread all over the surface of the Moon like bullets they'll punch through our curious astronauts no matter where they stand finally our explosion comes to an end on Earth the fireball Rises like a hot a balloon forming a sort of stalk as it reaches up cooler air is drawn in around it rounding the top into a mushroom cloud but on the moon well you know by now no atmosphere no mushroom the larger the plasma gets the cooler it becomes and the less energy it has to make interesting or terrifying things happen within seconds of pulling the trigger the bubble reddens and Fades from view it would be visible from the earth like a star flickering to life only to fade out right away a spark and then nothing as The Cloud of tiny debris reaches far above the surface of the Moon it's illuminated by the Sun for a few minutes giving it an eerie Beauty for anyone left to observe the spectacle what about the moon's orbit it's basically unchanged trying to move the moon with a nuke is like trying to move a truck by blowing on it nuclear explosions may be big but space is bigger our Mighty explosion just leaves another Ator one among Millions still anyone on the moon will continue to not enjoy themselves the material that ends up raining back to the Moon is radioactive and without any natural processes to wash it away or bury it the surface of the Moon will remain contaminated although fortunately the worst of the radiation will have decayed to a level comparable to Natural levels from cosmic rays in about a year in conclusion we can say with confidence that while the moon itself does not care about being m and we'll barely notice using the moon as a nuclear test ground kind of ruins it for everyone trying to spend some time there or to build something useful so maybe we should just not do that
4b33NTAuF5E,2020-12-10T14:54:18.000000,Can You Upload Your Mind & Live Forever?,"the desire to be free from the limits of The Human Experience is as old as our first stories we exist in an endless universe only Bound by the laws of physics and yet our Consciousness is trapped in Mortal machines made of meat with the breathtaking explosion of innovation and progress for the first time the concept of leaving our flesh piles behind and uploading our minds into a digital Utopia seems possible even like the logical next step on our evolutionary ladder upload what exactly mind is one of those words that are really hard to Define it's thought to be the collective abilities of your Consciousness and intelligence the thing that lets you imagine recognize and dream mind uploading is the hypothetical concept of making a copy of this inner world and transferring it into a computer to run a simulation of your consciousness but even defining the premise gets really hard really fast the possibility of Mind uploading is based on three assumptions assumption one your mind is in your brain's structure Arrangement and biochemistry the idea that everything about the mind can be found in the brain is called physicalism and it keeps our discussion within the domain of natural law assumption two at some point we will understand the brain well enough and possess the technology to simulate all of its aspects to make a digital mind copy assumption three computer software can host your mind which means the mind is computable there is no physical property in the brain including Consciousness that cannot be simulated accurately even if it requires a lot of code all of these assumptions have been proposed and challenged by scientists and philosophers and they Remain the subject of passionate debate with so many fundamental questions still unanswered it's hard to discuss the topic without annoying someone whatever your position every discussion of Mind upload has to begin with the brain the brain in a nutshell the brain is the most complex biological structure known and deserves its own entire video so let's just take a brief look at it around 100 billion neurons are communicating via 1 million billion in connections that are sending signals up to 1,000 times each second which is one quadrillion events every second of your Waking Life and it's not just neurons there are billions of supporting and immune cells of various types performing different jobs on a macro level the brain can be divided in two sections with different roles from breathing and heart rate to coordinating movement and involuntary reflexes the most developed Parts the neocortex or the outermost layer of the brain hold memories our ability to plan think and imagine hope and dream where exactly the U part of the brain is situated is not entirely clear we know that areas like the precuneous cortex have the greatest influence on our Consciousness but also that several areas can Network together to share tasks none of them can do alone the brain's building blocks are not exactly simple either neurons are not just wires they alter and process information synapses where signals are handed over from one neuron to the next contain receptors for hundreds of chemical signals opening them up to outside influence we have a basic understanding of how these work and we can accurately predict their behavior at small scales but there's a lot more to the brain than just nerve signals hormones play a huge role like serotonin which affects our mood or histamine which helps us learn the brain is influenced by our Parts too from heart nerves to gut bacteria what seemed like a very complicated system to begin with gets even more complicated the more we learn about it to get this wildly interconnected mess of cells and meat and chemicals into a computer we need a model that we can simulate in our Digital World some sort of scan unfortunately our scanning technology like fmri machines is not nearly good enough to attempt such a thing but there is a different method that seems very promising cutting a brain into tiny slices and scanning them with a high resolution electron microscope to create an accurate map of all the cells and Connections in 2019 scientists successfully mapped a cubic millimeter of mouse brain roughly the size of a big grain of sand it contained 100,000 neurons with a billion synapses and 4 km of nerve fibers this grain of brain was cut into 25,000 slices five electron microscopes ran continuously for 5 months collecting more than 100 billion images it took 3 months to assemble the images into a 3D model the completed data set fills up 2 million GB of cloud storage to scan a whole human brain we would have to repeat this effort a million times which is much easier said than done even worse to correctly simulate a brain we might even have to map out much smaller building blocks to include the billions of underlying proteins or even individual molecules that cause all the behaviors we see at the cellular level which might produce more data than the capacity of all data storage on Earth brain water to Consciousness wine while all of these issues are annoying the real question is how we turn the static blueprint of the brain into an active thing even if we have a scan down to the level of synapses we need need laws and rules that animate the wiring diagram to endow this static structure with life update it with the various laws of chemical binding of electrodynamics to animate the simulation so it becomes a dynamic active thing like a brain that exists from one microsc to the next that can evolve in time think see and act the reality is that we just don't know if this is possible to achieve if our technology can give rise to real Minds it all hinges on the nature of the problem are the brain and mind just complicated at a lot of work to figure out or are they complex in a way that we can't solve in the worst case Consciousness is more than the sum of the parts of the brain in a way that we don't realize yet complex in a way that we can't solve by getting better scans just having a list of the ingredients might not be enough to get a good consciousness cake right now we have a great starting point with tangible scientific results and an end goal but the road to True simulation is unclear and requires a lot of innovation and research humans have historically been horrible at predicting the pace of progress in the best case it's just a matter of doing the work and finding the right Solutions it might not be necessary to simulate every last cell down to the last atom instead it may be possible to simplify elements into probabilistic models that could match the behavior of the brain using a more manageable number of simpler systems so we really don't know if we will ever understand our brain and Consciousness well enough to upload human minds but the science is real and worth pursuing at the very least we will just learn a lot about ourselves and develop a bunch of new technologies if we succeed this might put mind uploading well within the capabilities of our rapidly progressing computer technology the consequences for Humanity and our future in this universe are vast creepy and amazing the copy successful mind uploading is functional immortality unless damaged or deleted you will continue to exist as long as a copy is stored somewhere of course if the scan is corrupted in any of a myriad of ways your mind might get corrupted too you might be in an eternity of pain or paranoia or having an endless psychotic breakdown the question if this digital mind is you opens another whole can of worms for now we'll just assume that your digital mind at least feels like it's you how would mind uploading change your outlook on life will you feel safer knowing that death is not necessarily the end or would you try to be super safe to avoid dying before your mind is uploaded if scanning technology does become Advanced enough your biological and digital versions could coexist you could help each other out by making your biological lifespan more enjoyable and the future of the copy more secure whatever happens your mind copy will begin a completely new life once it opens their digital eyes for the first time having a functional body is actually quite nice and you're pretty used to it food love pain and exhaustion all of these things are parts of us that we must live with but in the end they are the result of neurons firing in your brain so while you could decide to live in a simulated body it might be optional for a digital mind falling in love might lose meaning if you can have it at the Press of a button instead you might end up searching for new extraordinary experiences walk on the surface of the Sun speed up time to skip past a few boring months experience a simulation of the past your perspectives and priorities will change as you continue to exist in this liberated form the longer digital Minds exist eventually they will likely gain greater knowledge of themselves and an ability to change their own contents this can be as simple as deleting a memory that bugs you you might change aspects of your personality like grudges addictions or laziness without the constraints of biology your abilities might move up as technology progresses while your priorities or goals might become more and more foreign to your original brain if it's still alive waking up to the true potential of digital immortality will be gradual you can start projects that would take more than a lifetime to complete scientists could accumulate an incredible amount of knowledge leading to discoveries that could revolutionize the world adventurers could load themselves onto small spaceships and embark on Journeys to the Stars just putting themselves on pause for thousands of years at a time although it's unlikely that every digital mind will work for the benefit of humanity since our current meat versions don't do that either some will seek power and influence and will have a literal eternity of trying to create Empires others will begin hoarding as many resources for themselves as possible as they compete with other Minds trying to do the same the longer they live the less sympathy they may feel for simple meat beings or imagine Immortal cult leaders who propagate lies and invent religions fine-tuning and perfecting their Dogma over hundreds of years or perhaps none of all that maybe our minds are not made for immortality and digital Minds will just become rigid and unproductive and retire after a very long life having experienced to everything they could ever want to it's hard to predict how much good or bad a self-improving mind could do with hundreds or thousands of years of free time"
gLZJlf5rHVs,2020-12-01T15:00:41.000000,What If Earth got Kicked Out of the Solar System? Rogue Earth,"the night sky seems peaceful and orderly but in reality stars are careening through the Galaxy at speeds of hundreds of thousands of kilom per hour not bound by Static formations but changing neighborhoods constantly fortunately space is big and so the stars of the Milky Way are very unlikely to hit us Unfortunately they don't have to hit anything to make us have a really bad time on Earth and there are already Stars starting to get very close [Music] to understand how dangerous stars are to us we need to talk about gravity gravity attracts every piece of matter to every other piece of matter in the universe you are attracted by an atom a million light years away and vice versa luckily this Force gets weaker over distance and it also depends on how massive something is so things that are close and are very massive or more attractive winning the cosmic tug of war this way massive things Define how smaller things behave around them the sun makes up 99.75% of all the mass in the solar system and so it shapes the behavior and orbits of everything else in it billions of years ago after the sun was born the solar system was a chaotic and dangerous place as the planets were formed from countless little pieces that collided constantly but over the eons a stable balance emerged today most planets and asteroids have settled into safe and predictable orbits we have the inner and outer planets the asteroid and kyber belt and at the edge the or Cloud a giant sphere of comets orbiting slowly in Cold Storage we really don't want this balance to be disturbed if another star came too close to us its gravity would pull on everything in the solar system like a spoiled toddler messing up the pleasant order of the planets and asteroids and comets this this isn't some imaginary danger some 70,000 years ago a red dwarf brown dwarf binary system passed through the orc cloud and mess things up it might even have sent a deadly onslaught of asteroids our way but it could take 2 million years until those visitors from the orc Cloud arrive in the inner solar system but there's a much bigger problem on the horizon glea 710 a red dwarf with about half the mass of the Sun is currently headed towards the solar system in about a million Years it'll pass through the or cloud and become the brightest star in the night sky a close flyby like this would unfold over hundreds of thousands of years disrupting the orbits of millions of objects in the OR Cloud considerably if we're unlucky it will trigger a new period of planetary bombardment similar to the early solar system the night sky could be filled with comets and asteroids raining down on the inner solar system the larger ones could cause dinosaur level mass extinctions and would would be bad for the stock market but it could get much worse the Galaxy is an intense place and stars get close to each other regularly so it is possible that a star could come much closer and not just pass us but fly directly through the inner solar system this would be very bad in the extreme the chance of another star colliding with the sun is astronomically unlikely but that isn't what we're worried about if another star were to pass by about as close as the Earth is from the Sun it could easily eject the Earth from the solar system the odds of such an event are estimated to be around 1 in 100,000 in the next 5 billion years small but not absurdly so as we discussed in another video there seem to be billions of rogue planets doing their own thing in the galaxy and this is one way to make them so if this were to happen with an average Red Dwarf what would happen on Earth kicking Earth out of the solar system as the star enters the solar system a small orangish dot appears in the sky that grows bigger and bigger for months eventually becoming visible during the day it would get bigger and much brighter than the moon too bright to look at directly the night sky would be filled with an eery red glow after a few months it would start shrinking again but so would the sun over a few years the sun slowly grows smaller in the sky and with it warmth and Light start to dissipate all around the world as the days turn dark the final winter of humanity would begin the polar ice caps begin to grow and spread while plants shrivel and die forests freeze and animals die in droves as the Earth passes the orbit of Mars the average surface temperature has plummeted to near -50° C from space Earth begins to look like an icy Moon the blue green surface becoming the pale Gray white of death AS Global infrastructure breaks down people huddle together indoors burning what they can for warmth as the temperature continues to drop counting the days until they'll be out of food which no longer grows everybody living at the surface is living on borrowed time by the time Earth reaches Jupiter's orbit surface temperatures sink to -150° cus lower than the coldest ever recorded temperatures in Antarctica needless to say by now almost everyone is dead without the energy from sunlight to evaporate water clouds don't form and the water cycle stops the polar ice caps eventually touch at the equator and the oceans become covered in a thick layer of ice as more and more of its heat leaks out more water freezes onto the bottom of the ice sheet the concentration of salt in the deep ocean grows poisoning most animals that survived here although around hydrothermal vents communities of extreme chumiles might adapt even to these circumstances deep below the surface some bacteria would not notice much of any of this as they're still kept warm by the radioactive decay of elements in the Earth's core as the Earth reaches the orbit of Pluto and the Kyer belt the sun is still the brightest star in the sky but it's one among many with stars now visible during the day the temperature is now barely 40° C above absolute zero below the freezing temperature of the gases in the atmosphere a weird spectacle enjoyed by no one unfortunately unfolds as the atmosphere turns into nitrogen and then oxygen snow over a few years it's deposited into an icy 10 m thick sheet all over the planet's surface with only a thin Whisper of gas remaining the Frozen corpses of Flora and FAA are buried beneath them as Earth leaves the solar system it becomes a rogue planet traveling alone through the dark lifeless and in solitude but weirdly enough there is hope Humanity would not be surprised by this potential Extinction event we'd notice it thousands of years in advance there's not a lot we could do to stop a star but we could prepare most of us would perish but a few million could survive in huge artificial complexes powered by geothermal and nuclear energy possibly even Fusion if we can learn to use the ice around us for power here Humanity might survive for hundreds of thousands of years at some point we would become used to our circumstances and new generations would watch documentaries in disbelief about the time we had our own star and could walk the surface of Earth and at some point we might decide to look for another home if the Earth were lucky enough to pass by another star with a habitable planet we could try to make a fresh start space flight oddly enough would become very easy without the atmosphere in the way so it's not Unthinkable that the last survivors would leave Earth behind and try again on a new planet around a new star maybe one day thousands of years later the descendants of humanity will tell legends about Earth's ancient past stories of our lost home of a mysterious icy Planet floating alone and empty through the dark of space welcome to the courtz kazak lab let's conduct a few Stellar EXP experiments we'll first add some more mass to this protostar more a bit more wow we've just created a blue giant a star with 10 times the mass of our sun let's now add a couple of million years and see what happens a supernova

E1KkQrFEl2I,2020-11-10T15:00:26.000000,How Large Can a Bacteria get? Life & Size 3,"In and Out In and Out Staying Alive is about doing things this very second your cells are combusting glucose molecules with oxygen to make energy available which keeps you alive for another precious moment to get the oxygen to your cells you're breathing breathing is an answer to a very hard problem how do you get the resources that your cells need to survive from the outside to the inside of your cells every living thing has to solve this problem and the solution is surprisingly different depending on one of the most important Regulators of life size as we've discussed in other videos at different scales the physical laws of the universe have different consequences for its inhabitants simple things like temperature microgravity or surface tension might not matter to you or be a deadly Danger depending on how big you are living things need a lot of different materials to keep themselves going and they somehow need to transport them from the outside to the inside this was a huge problem for the first things on the verge of being alive because doing anything in our universe requires energy and the first living beings on Earth did not have the abundance of tools and techniques available that life has today after billions of years of evolution so at the very beginning life needed to find a way to get good stuff inside and bad stuff outside of itself without using energy luckily the very first forms of life were very very small and because they were so small they were able to use a free form of Transport that was based on a physical law called diffusion diffusion is the rule of the universe that molecules especially in liquids or gases are constantly moving around in all dire directions and because they move around and bump into each other and other molecules they tend to spread for example if you drop a sugar cube into water then there is a lot of sugar in one place and in another place there's none as sugar molecules dissolve in the water they will start randomly bumping against the water molecules and other sugar molecules slowly all the sugar molecules will spread out and form multiple phases of different concentrations these random movements continue endlessly until at some point the sugar will be spread evenly in the water the great thing about diffusion is that life can use it for free it doesn't require energy and life loves free things so all life on Earth relies on diffusion let's look at the smallest living being on earth a bacterium specifically its surfaces cell membranes allow for diffusion of certain molecules this specific bacterium consumes oxygen to Live While carbon dioxide is produced inside as a waste product so inside the bacterium there isn't a lot of oxygen but a lot of carbon dioxide because of diffusion these molecules will eventually spread evenly so the carbon dioxide diffuses out while oxygen is constantly replenished from the outside but this kind of breathing only works works for the very small world for bacteria amoeba or your cells and a few very small animals insects for example have a fine network of trachea tunnels with a pressure gradient where air very slowly can diffuse in and exchange gases with the insect cells but even insects seem to be able to contract their trachea and at least some even have specialized breathing organs like spiracles and air saxs at certain scales diffusion is just too too slow to keep cells alive the fundamental problem is that the exchange with the environment can only happen at the surface and diffusion of materials can only sustain a certain amount of inside tiny living things have only a little bit of inside or volume and a lot of outside or Surface area but what if we wanted to create a bacteria the size of a blue whale and had a very convenient enlargement machine we would sadly be messed up by the square Cube law in a nutshell it means that if you make something 10 times larger its outside or Surface would grow by 100 but its insides or volume Grows by 1,000 times if we compare the bacterium pseudomonas suroso with a blue whale we see that the bacterium has 10 million times more surface in relation to its volume than the whale the bacterium has a lot of outsides while the whale has a lot of insides if we make a bacterium the size of a whale our giant bacteria now has too much insight and most of its inside is now very far from its surface the oxygen our bacterium needs would never reach the inside before it would run out of oxygen our giant bacterium would just die still being bigger has many upsides from making making it harder to be eaten to making it easier to eat others but the size of cells is limited by the distance oxygen and nutrients can effectively diffuse to provide the inside with enough resources so life avoided this problem by forming multicellular structures beings composed of many cells instead of one because diffusion works better if you have many small units instead of one much bigger one over time the cell buddies began to share work and specialize some cells concentrated on sensing the environment others on digestion others on movement but that still wasn't enough the problem of diffusion and surface and energy production remained limiting the size these first multicellular forms of life could attain so in order to become even bigger life solved the diffusion Problem by having holes and caves and tunnels and by folding in on itself so diffusion Could Happen easily in each one of the cells take yourself what you consider your outside your skin has a surface area of about 2 square m but your lungs have a surface area of about 70 squ M they aren't like balloons they're more like sponges filled with many tightly packed tiny balloons surrounded by blood vessels when you breathe in all these tiny balloons fill up with fresh air blood filled up with CO2 is pumped around the balloons and then the magic of diffusion happens the oxygen diffuses into the blood where it's picked up by red blood cells and the CO2 diffuses out of the blood and into your lungs where it can be breathed out again your blood then carries oxygen rich blood into the furthest corners of your body and picks up the CO2 waste diffusion in the body is effective at about 1 mm so every cell in your body is at most 1 mm away from a blood vessel so medium-size animals like you need a lot of blood vessels to reach every cell in the body your body has around 100,000 km of capillaries alone the tiniest of your blood vessels with a surface area of around 1,000 square m this is true for all parts of you that want to exchange something with the outside outside world your body needs surfaces to take in nutrients from your food so your gut has the surface area of half a babington c roughly 40 square m the larger you are the more hidden surfaces you need take a tree it's way to stay alive is to create sugar out of thin air and sunlight so it needs as much surface area as possible an orange tree with 2,000 leaves has a leaf surface area of 200 sare M but the the surface inside the leaves where diffusion actually occurs is 6,000 s m the same with roots where water diffuses from the soil into countless tiny hairs that maximize the surface area the roots of 1 square m of grass add up to around 350 s m of surface if we look at the breathtaking diversity of Life on this planet it seems like everything is pretty different and it is but some basic principles are the same for everybody and have not changed significantly for billions of years if we look at the very very small or the very very big waste goes out and fresh fuel comes in big animals just need a lot of complex Plumbing to make it possible"
dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27T15:00:02.000000,Geoengineering: A Horrible Idea We Might Have to Do,by the end of the 21st century humanity is becoming desperate Decades of heat waves and droughts have led to unusually poor harvests while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year in the tropical zones Millions suffer from famines and resource Wars have made Millions more flee to the north as things quickly get worse in an act of desperation the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan it's far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out but the failure of world leaders to effectively address climate change makes it far from impossible so in the near future it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change geoengineering interventions so massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior or make everything much worse what is geoengineering is it really an option and what if it goes wrong [Music] geoengineering methods vary from Fantastic ones like constructing giant light sails in space to seeding clouds with salt or Wilder ones like fertilizing the oceans with iron to speed up the growth of trillions of algae cells in this video we'll focus on an intervention we could see during our lifetimes stratospheric aerosol injection a clunky term that means spraying stuff very high up in the atmosphere to keep the Sun away keeping the Sun away CO2 doesn't heat up the planet on its own almost all of the energy on Earth comes from the sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation about 71% of this energy is absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere this absorbed energy is emitted again as infrared radiation and CO2 is able to trap this infrared radiation and keep it in the atmosphere for a while you can compare this effect with snuggling under a blanket in the morning even in a really cold room your body emits infrared radiation and the air between your body and the blanket traps it and creates a warm and comfy feeling so one way to cool down the planet would be to prevent energy from getting trapped under our planet blanket which is already happening naturally about 29% of the solar radiation hitting Earth is reflected back to space by bright surfaces like ice deserts snow or clouds more reflection less energy less warming we can look at nature for inspiration specifically the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption the second largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century aside from massive Devastation and almost 900 dead scientists noted its strong impact on the global climate the explosion ejected millions of tons of particles and gas as high as the stratosphere which hung around there for a while the stuff that's interesting testing for geoengineering is sulfur dioxide a nasty smelling and invisible gas high in the atmosphere It produced a haze of sulfuric acid droplets that mixed with water and created giant veils these veils reduced the sunlight reaching Earth surface by roughly 1% global average temperatures dropped by 0.5° C it took 3 years until this cooling effect had stopped humans could imitate this process by injecting sulfur particles directly into the stratosphere According to some scientists this might be surprisingly easy to do and we don't even need a lot of new technology for it according to one study it also might be pretty cheap compared with the costs of Rapid climate change a small Fleet of specialized aircraft could Ascend once a year and distribute Aerosoles along the Equator from where they would be spread around the world projections assume that injecting between 5 and 8 megatons of material per year would reflect enough sunlight to slow down or even stop global warming giving us precious time to transition away from fossil fuels unfortunately there might be a few unhappy side effects there are a number of potential issues with aerosol injections rainfall patterns could change which could negatively affect agriculture and cause famine billions of people could be affected in the worst case also after the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption the acid water water veils not only cooled down the surface they also heated up the stratosphere as it turns out acid is bad for the ozone layer and the ozone hole over Antarctica was the largest it has ever been injecting sulfur particles over decades could have a similar effect scientists have already suggested using a combination of different minerals that might have much less harmful effects on the ozone layer but more research and experiments need to be done to make sure this could work but even if we don't damage the ozone layer there are other risks politicians and Industry might use the cooling effect as an excuse to delay the switch to a carbon neutral economy even if geoengineering slows down global warming humanity is still adding extra CO2 to the atmosphere more CO2 in the air means that the oceans absorb more CO2 which makes them more acidic this is already beginning to be deadly to huge ecosystems like coral reefs and the longer this continues the more severe the effects will be but it gets worse once we start pumping particles into the atmosphere on a massive scale we might be forced to do so for a long time or we could risk a termination shock what that means is that if Humanity continues to enrich the atmosphere with CO2 but at the same time prevents the planet from heating up by blocking solar radiation we're sitting on a time bomb once we stop geoengineering the natural cycle will take over again and Earth would heat up but after a few Decades of keeping the planet artificial cold while still releasing massive amounts of CO2 it would heat up much much quicker an increase in temperature that would take 50 years today could happen in just 10 years such a temperature shock in such a short time would disrupt every major system on Earth so much that it would be impossible to adapt in time the worst case scenario could be dramatic famines and the rapid destruction of ecosystems Humanity might survive but the survivors would inhabit an unfamiliar and hostile world world the best case scenario is that once the world has finally fully understood the existential danger of Rapid climate change geoengineering can bu us a crucial decade or two time to transition our economies and maybe even pull CO2 out of the atmosphere maybe with technologies that we'll discuss in a future video conclusion geoengineering is a scary concept it's not a solution to climate change and it might even be a welcome excuse for the fossil fuel industry to delay the end of the fossil fuel age over the last few decades geoengineering has been so controversial that it's stopped many scientists from doing the experiments necessary to understand it better but blankly opposing geoengineering is shortsighted the sad truth is we are already running a geoengineering experiment we're testing how fast the world changes if we add about 40 billion tons of CO2 each year this experiment is about to get really exciting hopefully we'll never have to use geoengineering but if we need to in the future we better have done the science we better be prepared or a panicking Humanity might accidentally press the self-destruct button
CWu29PRCUvQ,2020-10-06T14:00:12.000000,When Time Became History - The Human Era,"imagine someone coming into your kitchen and taking a few tools a pan and your garbage then they bury everything in the woods 12,000 years later an archaeologist is trying to figure out who you were what was important to you what video games you played what you believed in and what informed your decisions because you happened to live during a remarkable time in human history the planetary Revolution when Humanity transitioned becoming a multiplan species in that time our numbers would explode by orders of magnitude our technology and standard of living would improve to levels previously thought impossible and our self-conception would change forever and all the future archaeologist has to learn about is your junk in the woods while we can only hope that this will be someone's problem in 12,000 years we have the same problem today we're trying to reconstruct a reevolution ution that took place 12,000 years ago today only Shadows remain of the people who experienced our distant past as their present what remains from our past we can look at our present in crispy 4K in color and sound three generations ago the world was just black and white one more generation and we see the world through blurred photographs further back paintings and texts become our main way of experiencing the past a mere 20 Generations before us today every written word had to be copied by hand and reports became more scarce and less reliable the first historian lived a mere 100 Generations ago before him there are only epics and legends and dead Kings bragging on pieces of stone 250 Generations ago there are only fragments left in the ground and and images stripped of their original meaning eventually Humanity becomes basically invisible still we do know some things about our ancestors let's try to tell their story and what it means for us today the greatest transition in human history for some 2 million years or roughly 880,000 Generations the life of our ancestors was basically the same it was around 20,000 years or 800 Generations ago that the behaviorally modern humans began a process that would change our lifestyle Forever at first gradually for some of us then faster for more of us and then suddenly for almost all of us back then there were about 1 million modern humans on Earth most other human species had died out probably With a Little Help from us our ancestors biology had given them the necessary tools a general intelligence to understand things a social intelligence to understand each other and language to express abstract ideas and create new Concepts these were people just like you they suffered and experienced Joy were bored cried and laughed they lived in communities of a few dozen people they controlled fire and had tools made from wood Stone and Bone told stories mourned their dead and created art they traded with other tribes from obsidian to shellfish some hunted big game and were very mobile others relied more on plants they collected and others mostly stayed in one area with an abundance of seafood this was the common state of humanity for most of our history until a slow transition step by step turned into a [Music] Revolution Step by Step the first solid evidence for this stand from the Jordan Valley where our ancestors collected wild wheat more than 20,000 years ago they noticed that seeds in the ground made more plants the next year if they put good ones in one place the next year they had more of the good ones this was a great supplement to hunting and Gathering you could prepare some crops return next year build a temporary settlement and have a secure food supply our ancestors used these bonus crops to bake the first bread and Brew the first beer with every generation they gathered deeper knowledge about the plants and animals around them and how to manipulate them to their advantage but there was a lot to learn very slowly from generation to generation pockets of knowledge expanded and were passed along to be expanded again this early agriculture started to drastically reduce the space our ancestors needed to feed one individual which made it possible to stay in one place longer around 12,000 years ago the these little pieces of progress had reached to critical mass most of the calories we consume today stem from about 15 different founder crops that humans began to domesticate in Earnest in the next few thousand years what we call the Agricultural Revolution was not a thing that began suddenly one day it was a slow process driven by small groups over many generations eventually gradual change gave rise to a new era the human era during the next few thousand years progress would speed up and turn hunter gatherers into farmers who lived in villages towns and then cities when Farmers moved into new areas they replaced the nomadic tribes or turned them into Farmers too this was neither easy nor painless in the early days people had a diverse diet made up of up to 250 different plants and animals for some of the groups transitioning to agriculture the variation in their diets declined drastically and some even seem to have been undernourished and living close together and with animals created a breeding ground for disease virtually every infectious disease caused by microorganisms that have adapted to humans arose in the last 10,000 years chera smallpox measles influenza chickenpox and malaria mortality especially among children Rose drastically still our numbers grew because living in the same place enabled women to Bear far more children than before and for a farmer more kids mean more hands to work the fields even with more people dying younger Villages and towns grew the number of humans on Earth exploded about 100 Generations after the beginning of the human era there were already 4 million of us this increased the need for food and forced people to come up with ever more efficient ways of producing calories solidifying our new lifestyle going back to hunting and Gathering would have just meant death by starvation for most one question remains unanswered why why would people exchange the freedom of living off nature with a huge Variety in food for the grind of Agriculture and often more limited diets nobody knows for sure climate change seems to have made the transition possible and some scientists argue that it was caused by external factors like under nourishment or overpopulation both highly contested today the most widely accepted idea is that it was a deliberate Choice made by countless communities around the globe maybe it's also connected with what makes us human the ability to come together develop shared identities and exchange stories and knowledge some archaeologists think the groups of hunter gatherers traveled long and far to celebrate to hold feasts and rituals they would have used these occasions to talk about their version of innovation better hunting and Tool making techniques how to catch and breed animals and which plants could be collected and multiplied maybe they even exchanged seeds it's not unlikely that these gatherings were the Catalyst that spread the knowledge of Agriculture through the many isolated groups of humanity ultimately ending a lifestyle that was common to our species for thousands of generations so by being able to come together celebrate share and learn from one another these humans might have taken the steps that led to our modern world and we have much to be grateful for we are still the same humans today even if it often doesn't feel that way maybe it's time to come together to share what we know and celebrate our existence once again to begin another peaceful transition maybe the planetary Revolution that will change everything once more so hopefully in another 1200 th000 years our descendants will look back on us today with gratitude for the amazing world they are able to inhabit"
wbR-5mHI6bo,2020-09-29T14:00:26.000000,"Is It Too Late To Stop Climate Change? Well, it's Complicated.","Climate change is just too much. There's never any good news. Only graphs that get more and more red and angry. Almost every year breaks some horrible record, from the harshest heat waves to the most rapid glacier melt. It's endless, and relentless. We've known for decades that rapid climate change has been caused by the release of greenhouse gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO₂ than in the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it so hard to just stop emitting these gases? Our collective CO₂ emissions can be expressed as a product of four factors and their relationship with each other. Two of them explain why worldwide CO₂ emissions are still rising, and two explain how we can stop that. Population Size, Economic Growth, Energy Intensity, and Emissions pere Energy unit produced. Number 1: Population Size People need food, homes, and clothing. And they demand luxury products from iPhones to one dollar cheeseburgers more people = higher CO₂ emissions. It's a very simple equation. The global population is growing, and according to the UN it will level off at about 11 billion in 2100, which is 40% more than today. The only way to slow down this growth is investment in healthcare, and access to contraception and education in developing countries. But even with massive investment, it will take a few decades for the effects of lower birthrates to manifest themselves, so the global population will keep growing for the foreseeable future, and, as a consequence, global CO₂ emissions rise over the next few decades. Number 2: Growth, or ""Getting Richer"". But it's not just about our numbers, The richer and more developed we are, the more emissions our lifestyle produces. A programmer in the US has a higher CO₂ footprint than 50 farmers in Uganda. The world's wealth is growing almost everywhere. And although it's far from easily distrubuted, economic growth has led to the highest standards of living, and the largest reduction in extreme poverty in human history. Growth has become the dominant mantra of the world's economies, no matter what kind of political system they have. It's unlikely that rich countries will give up the concept of growth any time soon. But even if they were to, developing countries want to become rich too For billions of people, the end of growth would probably mean staying poor and so developing countries are not willing to stop growing their economies. All in all, we can agree that growth as a guiding economic ideology is not going to go away any time soon. More countries and their citizens around the world will grow and become richer while the rich economies will continue to grow their wealth. There are some signs that growth can be decoupled from CO₂ emissions but we're not close to that yet. As a consequence of this growth, CO₂ emissions will rise. Ok, so far we've learned that because of population growth and economic growth, humanity's CO₂ emissions will increase. ...which is the opposite of what should be happening. We need to slow, peak, and then reduce annual emissions. The next two factors describe how we can actually do this. Number 3: Energy Intensity Energy intensity describes how efficiently we use energy. A street food vendor in rural Brazil might burn coal to cook... while a street food vendor in France might use an induction stove powered by nuclear energy. The latter is way more efficient. The more efficient something is, the less energy we need to do something. Be it powering a metropolitan area, or grilling a kebab. So making our technology more efficient, and coming up with more efficient ways to organise our societies is one of the most important ways to reduce the modern world's CO₂ dependancy. This can mean everything from reducing power consumption with A.I., the electrification of the transportation and industrial sectors, or sustainable concrete production. The opportunities for improvement are almost limitless, and human ingenuity can run wild. But we know that increasing efficiency alone will not be enough, mostly for 3 reasons: 1: Direct Rebound Effects. This means that once something becomes more efficient, it's used more, and so overall, the increased efficiency does not lead to a reduction as impressive as you would first think. ...or worse, sometimes more efficiency makes humans use not *less* of a resource, but *more* of it. When planes became more fuel-efficient, ticket prices decreased, and more people started to travel by plane. So making things more efficient does not automatically mean less energy use in total. It might have the opposite effect. 2: Indirect Rebound Effects. Sometimes when you save money on a thing that becomes more efficient, you might spend it elsewhere. For example, if you buy a more fuel-efficient car, you save money on fuel, and end up with extra funds in your bank account... ...that you might spend on vacation, and take a flight with. So in the end, you might actually emit more CO₂ despite getting a more efficient car. 3: And lastly, the more you optimise for efficiency, the harder and more expensive it becomes to get more efficient. So, over time, the return on investment slows down. And, with many technologies, we are already pretty efficient. But, regardless of how efficient we make our economies, as long as we need at least some energy, we will have emissions. Efficiency alone won't create a zero-carbon world. This brings us to our last factor: Number 4: CO₂ emissions per energy unit used, or ""Our Global Carbon Footprint"". Humanity's global carbon footprint is the CO₂ released per energy unit generated. For example, coal plants release much much more CO₂ than solar power per unit of energy. This relationship is crystal clear. The more fossil fuels we burn, the higher our CO₂ output. Fossil fuels are the greatest lever humanity has right now. Of course, it's impossible to shut down coal and oil overnight without throwing society into chaos. But the reality is, that we're not doing nearly enough to keep fossil fuels in the ground and use lower-carbon alternatives We need to do 2 things to speed the transition away from fossil fuels. First, we need to use the real leverage we have today, with today's technology There are a lot of things we can do extremely quickly. We can leave nuclear power plants online longer. We can cut subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, and funnel them into renewables. We can price carbon emissions harshly, and increase the price each year to create strong incentives for the world's industries to transition. We can enforce strict standards for energy efficiency, and for any type of new construction. We can phase out fossil fuel vehicles. Next, we also need to invent new and better technology. Without new technologies and innovation, it will be impossible to achieve a zero CO₂ emission world, be it from technologies like carbon capture, or a new generation of nuclear power plants, to new batteries that revolutionise the energy storage from renewables. But innovation takes time: years, and decades... ...and we don't have this time. Every year, we keep adding more carbon to the atmosphere. This means we can't keep relying on innovation alone. We need to find ways to reduce emissions today, while we invent what we will need in the future. The less fossil fuel we burn over the next few years, the more time we give innovation to catch up. The more low-carbon energy infrastructure we build today, the more we can compensate for economic growth, and the people born today. The more coal power plants in construction we stop from being finished, the more CO₂ we save. Neither innovation, nor the alternatives we're using today alone can solve rapid climate change. But, innovation, together with a decisive move away from fossil fuels where it's possible today could do it. Solving climate change will be complicated. We have to account for the needs of billions of people and the reality that right now, society runs mostly on fossil fuels. This will not change overnight, but it needs to change as quickly as possible. And it is still very much possible🤞🏻 We'll look at different aspects of climate change, and how to solve it in more videos. Let us know what kind of stuff you want to know more about Here on YouTube, or join us in our subreddit This video is part of a series about climate change supported by Breakthrough Energy, a coalition founded by Bill Gates, that's working to expand clean energy investment and support the innovations that will lead the world to net-zero carbon emissions Also, a special thanks to the team at Our World in Data, for helping us out with data & research *quack* 🦆"
3mnSDifDSxQ,2020-09-22T15:17:30.000000,The Largest Star in the Universe – Size Comparison,"What is the largest star in the universe and why is it that large? And what are stars anyway? Things That Would Like To Be Stars We begin our journey with Earth. Not to learn anything, just to get a vague sense of scale. The smallest things that have
some star-like properties are large gas giants, or sub-brown dwarfs. Like Jupiter, the most massive
planet in the solar system. Eleven times larger and 317
times more massive than Earth, and more or less, made of
the same stuff as our Sun. Just much, much less of it. The transition towards stars
begins with brown dwarfs, failed stars, that are a huge
disappointment to their moms. They have between 13 and 90
times the mass of Jupiter. So even if we took 90 Jupiters and
threw them at each other, although fun to watch, it wouldn't be enough to create a star. Interestingly, adding lots of mass
to a brown dwarf doesn't make it much bigger, just its insides denser. This increases the pressure
in the core enough to make certain nuclear fusion
reactions happen slowly, and the object glow a little. So brown dwarfs are a sort of glowy
gas giant, that don't fit into any category very
well. But we want to talk about stars, not failed wannabe stars, so let's
move on. Main Sequence Stars Once large gas balls pass a certain
mass threshold, their cores become hot and dense
enough to ignite. Hydrogen is fused to helium in their
cores, releasing tremendous amounts of energy. Stars that do that are called 
main sequence stars. The more massive a main sequence star is, the hotter and brighter it burns, and the shorter its life is. Once the hydrogen-burning phase is over, stars grow up to hundreds of 
thousands of times their original size. But these giant phases only last for a
fraction of their lifespan. So we'll be comparing stars at 
drastically different stages in their lives. This doesn't make them less impressive, but maybe it's good to keep in mind
that we'll be comparing babies to adults. Now back to the beginning, the smallest real stars are red dwarfs. About 100 times the mass of Jupiter; barely massive enough to fuse
hydrogen to helium. Because they are not very massive they are small, not very hot, and shine
pretty dimly. They are the only stars in the main
sequence that don't grow once they die but sort of fizzle out. Red dwarfs are by far the most abundant type in the universe, because they burn their fuel so slowly, it lasts them up to ten trillion years - a thousand times the current age of
the universe. For example, one of the closest stars
to Earth is a red dwarf star, Barnard's Star, but it shines too dimly to be seen
without a telescope. We made a whole video on red dwarfs
if you want to learn more. The next stage are stars like our Sun. To say the Sun dominates the solar system is not doing it justice since it makes up 99.86% of all its mass. It burns far hotter and brighter than
red dwarfs, which reduces its lifetime to about 10
billion years. The Sun is 7 times more massive than
Barnard's Star, but that makes it nearly 300 times
brighter with twice its surface temperature. Let's go bigger! Small changes in mass produce enormous changes in a main sequence star's
brightness. The brightest star in the night sky,
Sirius, is 2 solar masses with a radius 1.7 times that of the Sun, but its surface is nearly 10,000°C, making it shine 25 times brighter. Burning THAT hot reduces its total lifespan by 4 times to 2.5 billion years. Stars close to 10 times the mass of
our sun have surface temperatures near 25,000°C. Beta Centauri contains two of these
massive stars, each shining with about 20,000 times
the power of the Sun. That's a lot of power coming from something only 13 times larger, but they'll only burn for about 20
million years. Entire generations of the blue stars
die in the time it takes for the Sun to orbit the galaxy
once. So is this the formula? The more massive, the larger the star. The most massive star that we know
is R136a1. It has 315 solar masses and is nearly 9 million times brighter
than the Sun. And yet, despite its tremendous mass
and power, it's barely 30 times the size of the Sun! The star is so extreme and barely held
together by gravity that is loses 321 thousand billion tons of material through its stellar wind every single second. Stars of this sort are extremely rare
because they break the rules of star formation a
tiny bit. When supermassive stars are born they burn extremely hot and bright and this blows away any extra gas that could make them more massive. So the mass limit for such a star is around 150 times the Sun. Stars like R136a1 are probably formed
through the merger of several high mass stars in dense star-forming regions and burn their core hydrogen in only
a few million years. So this means they are rare and short
lived. From here the trick to going bigger
isn't adding more mass. To make the biggest stars we have to kill them. Red Giants When main sequence stars begin to exhaust the hydrogen in their core it contracts making it hotter and denser. This leads to hotter and faster fusion which pushes back against gravity and makes the outer layers swell in a
giant phase. And these stars become truly giant indeed. For example, Gacrux. Only 30% more massive than the Sun, it has swollen to about 84 times its
radius. Still, when the Sun enters the last
stage of its life, it will swell and become even bigger; 200 times its current radius! In this final phase of its life it will swallow the inner planets. And if you think THAT'S impressive let's finally introduce the largest stars
in the universe: Hypergiants Hypergiants are the giant phase of the 
most massive stars in the universe. They have an enormous surface area that can radiate an insane amount of 
light. Being so large they're basically
blowing themselves apart as gravity at the surface is too weak to 
hold on to the hot mass which is lifted away in powerful stellar 
winds. Pistol Star is 25 solar masses but 300 times the radius of the sun; a blue hypergiant aptly named for its 
energetic blue starlight. It's hard to say exactly how long Pistol
Star will live but probably just a few million years. Even larger than the blue hypergiants are the yellow hypergiants. The most well studied is Rho Cassiopeiae; a star so bright it can be seen with the 
naked eye although it's thousands of lightyears from Earth. At 40 solar masses, this star is around 500 times the
radius of the Sun, and 500,000 times brighter. If the Earth were as close to Rho 
Cassiopeiae as it is to the Sun it'd be inside it and you would be very
dead. Yellow hypergiants are very rare though. Only 15 are known. This means they're likely just a 
short-lived intermediate state as a star grows or shrinks between
other phases of hypergiantness. With red hypergiants we reach the
largest stars known to us. Probably the largest stars even possible! So who's the winner of this insane
contest? Well the truth is we don't know. Red hypergiants are extremely bright
and far away which means the even tiny
uncertainties in our measurements can give us a huge margin of error for
their size. Worse still are solar system sized
behemoths that are blowing themselves apart which makes them harder to measure. As we do more science and our
instruments improve whatever the largest star is will change. The star that is currently thought to
be among the largest we've found is Stephenson 2-18. It was probably as a main sequence
star a few tens of times the mass of the sun and has likely lost about half its mass
by now. While typical red hypergiants are 1500
times the size of the Sun, the largest rough estimate places
Stephenson 2-18 at 2150 solar radii, and shining with almost half a million
times the power of the Sun! By comparison the Sun seems like a
grain of dust. Our brains don't really have a way of
grasping this kind of scale. Even at lightspeed it would take you 
8.7 hours to travel around it once. The fastest plane on Earth would take
around 500 years! Dropped on the Sun it would fill
Saturn's orbit! As it evolves it would probably shed
even more mass and shrink down into another hotter
hypergiant phase, accumulate heavy elements in its core, before finally exploding in a core
collapse supernova, giving its gas back to the galaxy. This gas will then go on to form
another generation of stars of all sizes. Starting the cycle of birth and death
again to light up our universe. Let's make this journey again but this time without the talking. The universe is BIG. There are many large things in it. If you want to play a bit more with size
stuff we have good news! We've crated our first app, Universe In
A Nutshell, together with Tim Urban, the brain
behind Wait But Why. You can seamlessly travel from the
smallest things in existence, past the coronavirus, human cells and dinosaurs, all the way to the largest stars
and galaxies, and marvel at the whole observable
universe! You can learn more about each object, or simply enjoy the sheer scale of it all. The app is inspired by the Scale Of
The Universe website by the Huang twins, that we spent a lot of time with when
it came out years ago, and felt that it was finally time to
create a Wait But Why and Kurzgesagt version. You can get it in your app store, there are no in-app purchases, and no ads. All future updates are included. And since this is our first app we'd love to hear your feedback so we can improve it over time. If this sounds good to you download the Universe In A Nutshell

B3QTAgHlwEg,2020-08-30T12:29:48.000000,These Ants Use Their Babies As Glue Guns,"Deep in tropical jungles 
lie floating kingdoms, ruled by beautiful and deadly masters. They're sort of the high elves
of the ant kingdoms; talented architects that
create castles and city-states. But they are also fierce
and expansionist warriors, and their kingdoms are ensnared
in a never-ending war for survival. 'Oecophylla Weaver Ants' [Intro music] Oecophylla weavers walk on long legs, have slender bodies, and large eyes, which make them look pretty cute. Although, their strong mandibles
and the ability to shoot acid also make them pretty good at killing. But more on that later. Their colonies usually have
two to three worker classes that vary dramatically in size: majors, minors, and sometimes
even tiny minim workers. Depending on location and species, they vary in color from dark
brown to emerald green. Other than their fancy looks,
what makes weavers special is that they're in the
kingdom-building business. They like to build at
pretty much all heights, starting in shrubs a few
centimeters above the ground, and up to 10 meters in the tree canopy. But, they're not satisfied
with ruling just one plant. Weavers will look for twigs or lianas
that bridge the gap to other trees, and expand to every plant they can reach. This way, colonies spread upwards
and sideways through the treetops. The largest weaver ant
kingdoms we know of occupy up to 1,600 square meters, around four basketball courts, a lot of ground to cover for tiny ants, and impossibly hard to control. So, weaver ants construct dozens of
nests scattered all over their territory: outposts to defend the kingdom, tubes or balls made from leaves,
and ghostly silk sheets. These masterpieces
of high-ant architecture are created by the weaver majors, the larger worker ants, which are
responsible for the more dangerous jobs like fighting, foraging,
and nest construction. To start a new nest, a major tries to bend different leaves
in her surroundings into a tube. If one of the leaves is flexible enough,
more workers will arrive to help. Chains of workers pull
the leaf's edges together or reach across gaps and grab distant
leaves to add them to the construction. While the bending and pulling is going on, other workers carry larvae from the
closest nest to the construction site. Usually, ant larvae spin themselves
a cocoon to protect themselves. But the weaver ant larvae give all of their
silk to the colony as building material. So, when the workers tap the
larvae's heads on the leaf, they release their sticky thread
like tiny, cute glue guns. This way, the workers sew the bent leaf
onto itself so it won't unfold anymore. This creates a central chamber, that's used as the basis for up to 300
more leaves that are wound around it. Together, they form little pockets and act
as additional rooms for the new outpost. To make it even more cozy, minor workers use the larvae to weave
additional floors and chambers. Nests are usually constructed as
barracks on the territory's borders, or as storage for brood and food supplies. This way, the ants don't need to cross
vast distances to the headquarters, but have soldiers close to
any potential point of conflict. Apart from one special nest
in the middle of the network, which is reserved for the
queen and her guards. Here, she produces
hundreds of eggs a day, which get transferred to suitable
nests with brood chambers. So, a colony is a network
of little castles and moats, connected by suspension bridges
made from leaves, lianas, and twigs. An established colony easily has half a
million individuals that need to be fed. Fortunately, weaver ants
evolve to have very close and beneficial relationships
with their hosts: shrubs and trees. The tree gives the ants a home
and access to sweet sap to drink. But maybe even more importantly,
it allows them to cultivate cattle, like aphids or caterpillars, that
produce honeydew for them. This would usually hurt a tree, but these insects belong
to a small group of VIPs. Only a few selected neighbours and the
ants' cattle are allowed on the fruit tree. Many other insects, and even
larger herbivores are scared off, or even killed and eaten. So in most cases, the tree only has to
tolerate acceptable levels of damage while being protected from
more dangerous pests. The weaver ant kingdom could be an
ant paradise if there wasn't competition, mostly from other kingdoms. Just like medieval humans, every queen seeks to conquer others
and make their land their own. Controlling fertile land is the
key to survive in the jungle. And if a kingdom loses too much of it, it
shrinks and is overrun or starves to death. So expanding and defending their borders
is critical to keep the colony alive. When a kingdom invades another, it first gathers an army of
a few thousand majors who make their way towards
the opposing colony. The goal is to steal a bit of
territory and take it over. Defending weaver patrols
quickly spot the invaders and immediately release
an alarm pheromone. Some rush to the front to defend, while others rush to the
closest outposts for help, marking their route with pheromones. Whenever they meet other sisters, they jerk their bodies as if in a fight, to signal them to follow the
pheromone trail to the front line. At the site of battle, majors from
both parties raise their bodies, circle each other with
mandibles wide open, and try to seize their opponents. If an ant gets a hold of her opponent, the victim is pulled into a group of
allied majors and pinned down. The ants then rip the victim apart, clipping off antennae and legs, and slicing open their abdomens. To slow down the advance of the attackers, the defending majors squirt
formic acid over the battlefield, to chemically burn their targets. This is soon answered in the
same way by the attackers. In the chaotic battle, both parties lose countless fighters
on the increasingly acidic battlefield. After a few minutes, the backup
from the outposts arrive, and the time window for a
successful attack slowly closes. This is when the battle turns. The defenders slowly push
back the attack party. In the end, the attackers can't
keep up and have to retreat. For both parties, it was a costly battle. Thousands of corpses lie piled up
on the ground under the battlefield, and many ants are severely injured. The defending colony's nests
and brood are safe though. The attackers' attempt to steal
new valuable territory has failed... ...for today. They'll try again soon. But the kingdom will be ready. For the high ants of
the floating kingdoms, war is nothing special. It's just a fact of life. Because as we know, empires
never, ever have enough. And the weaver ants are ready to fight. *quack*

y8XvQNt26KI,2020-08-16T12:29:23.000000,Unlimited Resources From Space – Asteroid Mining,"Аhhh, casually watching a video on YouTube on a computer more powerful than anything humanity could build a few decades ago. Тhis progress and all the wonderful machines you take for granted are built on a few rare and precious materials with names like Terbium, Nneodymium or Tantalum. Getting these rare materials from the ground into your devices is ugly The mining industry is responsible for air and water pollution and the destruction of entire landscapes. Dangerous chemicals like cyanide, sulphuric acid or chlorine are used to extract the resources, harming biodiversity, workers and locals. And rare resources are also political tools, when countries restrict access to them to get their way. But what if we could replace the mining industry on earth, with a clean process that can't harm anyone? Well, we can; all we need to do is look up. (catchy introductory music by Kurzgesagt) Asteroids are millions of trillions of tons of rocks, metals, and ice. Leftovers from the cloud that became the planet 4.5 billion years ago. They can be as small as a meter or proto-planets the size of entire countries. Most of them are concentrated in the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt while hundreds of thousands more do their own thing between the planets. As space travel is becoming more feasible scientists and economists have been begun looking at the resources found in these asteroids. Even relatively small metallic asteroids may contain trillions worth of industrial and precious metals like platinum. And bigger asteroids like 16 Psyche could contain enough iron nickel to cover the world's metal needs for millions of years. At current market prices the rare raw materials alone would be worth quadrillions of dollars. Well, not really. But technically. For example, there are more than 20 million tons of gold in the ocean's water worth roughly 750 trillion U.S. dollars. But filtering out the gold would be so expensive that you'd lose money selling it. Right now asteroid mining has exactly this problem. It's too expensive to replace mining on Earth. Billions of dollars worth of valuable resources in space are worthless if it costs trillions to get them. What makes it so hard? The principals behind mining an asteroid are simple. The basic idea is to choose an asteroid move it to a place where it's easy to process, and then take it apart to turn into useful products. Unfortunately all of this collides with fundamental problems humans have yet to solve Going to space is expensive. It costs thousands of dollars in rocket fuel for each kilogram, just to reach a low earth orbit. Going further out into deep space costs thousands more. We need cheaper space travel to make asteroid mining profitable. One solution is to switch from classical rockets to electric spaceships. We already use electrical rocket engines
for many of the space probes on science missions. In principal, we only need to build bigger ones. While electrical engines are not powerful enough to fly to space they require only a tiny amount of fuel to go very far once they're in space. This means we don't need to spend a lot of money on fuel only to transport fuel into space. This doesn't solve the whole cost problem- but it makes it easier to start our first mission. Now that we have an electric asteroid-mining spaceship, we need to find the right asteroid and get it there. We've already successfully visited asteroids with space probes and even collected samples. Still, to make it easier and cheaper our first targets will probably be near-Earth asteroids. Asteroids that orbit, well, near Earth. After a few months of travel our spaceship finally arrives at an asteroid. Weirdly formed, littered with small impact craters, it hasn't changed much for billions of years. The first thing that needs to be done is
to secure the asteroid and stop it from spinning. There are multiple ways to do this, like vaporizing material with a laser or stopping the rotation with thrusters. Once we have a stable asteroid, we need to wait. Orbital mechanics are complicated, but if you push something in the right direction
at exactly the right moment, you can move very big things with very little force. So, we wait for exactly the right moment. Our ship fires its thrusters and nudges the asteroid into a trajectory that takes it near our Moon. The Moon is useful because we can borrow its gravitational pull to put the asteroid
in a stable orbit around Earth, which saves even more fuel. Again, the trip takes months. But all the time since our ship was launched
has not been wasted. The first space mining and processing equipment
has been installed in orbit, and is now carefully moving towards the asteroid. The processor works very differently than on Earth. Giant mirrors focus sunlight and heat up asteroid rock to boil out the gases. Grinders break up the dried rocks into gravel and dust, and centrifuges separate dense from light elements. Even if we only extract 0.01% of the asteroid's mass
in precious metals, this is still several times more than
you'd get from the same amount of ore on the ground. But what now? How do we get our
precious metals safely back to ground? There are a few ways, like
loading it into reusable rockets that return to Earth from space. Or if our processor contains 3-D printers, we can print a faster and cheaper delivery system. Heat shielded capsules filled with gas bubbles. These can just be dropped into the oceans
where ships tow them away. This could be the starting point of
humanity's first real steps towards colonizing the solar system. As our infrastructure and experience grows, our missions get more and more sophisticated. Parts and fuel produced on asteroids don't have to be launched from Earth at all. The first mining operation makes the second one easier,
and so on. While the space industry grows and precious materials become cheaper, eventually we could stop mining on Earth. Even the idea of toxic mining down here might become something weird and anachronistic, like having an open fire in your living room. Landscapes ravaged by pollution will heal, while the technological wonders we're used to get cheaper and less toxic to make. None of this is science fiction. We don't need fancy materials or new physics to make asteroid mining happen. We could start building this future today. All we need is an initial ... push!"
rhFK5_Nx9xY,2020-08-02T12:29:49.000000,What Do Alien Civilizations Look Like? The Kardashev Scale,"An observable universe is a big place
that's been around for more than 13 billion years. Up to two trillion galaxies made up of
something like 20,000 billion billion stars surround our home galaxy. In the Milky Way alone, scientists assume there are some
40 billion earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their stars. When we look at these numbers, it's hard to imagine
that there is nobody else out there. It would change our perception of ourselves forever
if we found others. Just knowing that this vast place is not dead
would shift our perspective outward, and could help us get over
our irrelevant quarrels. But before looking for our
new best friends, or worst enemies, we have a problem to solve:
What are we actually looking for? [Kurzgesagt intro] In a universe that big and old, we have to assume that civilizations
start millions of years apart from eachother, and develop in different directions and speeds. So not only are we looking over distances of
dozens to hundreds of thousands of light years, we're looking for a civilization
ranging from cavemen to super advanced. So, we need a conceptual framework
to enable us to think better thoughts that make us able to search better. Are there universal rules that
intelligent species follow? Currently our civilization sample size is only one, so we may make incorrect assumptions
based solely on ourselves. Still, better than nothing. We know that humans started out with nothing
but minds and hands that could build tools. We know that humans are curious, competitive,
greedy for resources, and expansionist. The more of these qualities our ancestors had, the more successful they were
in the civilization building game. Being one with nature is nice, but it's not the path
to irrigation systems, or gunpowder, or cities. So it's reasonable to assume that aliens able to
take over their home planet also have these qualities. And, if aliens have to follow
the same laws of physics, then there is a measurable metric for progress:
Energy use. Human progress can be measured very precisely
by how much energy we extracted from our environment, and how we made it
usable to do things. We started with muscles,
until we learned to control fire. Then we made machines that
used kinetic energy from water and wind. As our machines got better
and our knowledge of materials expanded, we began to harness the concentrated energy
from dead plants we dug up from the ground. As our energy consumption grew exponentially,
so did the abilities of our civilization. Between 1800 and 2015,
population size had increased sevenfold, while humanity was consuming
25 times more energy. It's likely that this process
will continue into the far future. Based on these facts, scientist Nikolai Kardashev
developed a method of categorizing civilizations, from cave dwellers to gods ruling over galaxies: The Kardashev Scale;
a method of ranking civilizations by their energy use. The scale has been refined and
expanded on over the decades, but in general it puts civilizations
into four different categories. A Type 1 civilization is able to use the
available energy of their home planet. A Type 2 civilization is able to use the
available energy of their star and planetary system. A Type 3 civilization is able to use the
available energy of their galaxy. A Type 4 civilization is able to use the
available energy of multiple galaxies. These levels differ by orders of magnitude. It's like comparing an ant colony
to a human metropolitan area. To, ants we are so complex and powerful,
we might as well be gods. So to make the scale more useful,
we need subcategories. On the lower end of the spectrum,
there are Type 0 to Type 1 civilizations: Anything from hunter-gatherers, to something
we could achieve in the next few hundred years. These might actually be
abundant in the Milky Way. But a civilization that is not
actively transmitting radio signals into space might be as close as our nearest stellar neighbor,
the Alpha Centauri system, and we would have no way of
realizing they exist. But even if they transmitted radio signals
like we do, it might not be very helpful. On an interstellar scale,
humanity is practically invisible. Our signals may extend over
an impressive 200 light years, but this is only a tiny fraction
of the Milky Way. And even if someone were listening, after a few light years
our signals decay into noise, impossible to identify as
the source of an intelligent species. Today, humanity ranks at about level 0.75. We have altered our planet: we've created huge structures,
mined and stripped mountains, removed rainforests, and drained swamps. We've created rivers and lakes, and changed the composition and temperature
 of the atmosphere. If progress continues,
and we don't make Earth uninhabitable, we will become a full Type 1 civilization
in the next few hundred years. Any civilization that becomes a Type 1
is bound to look outside, because it's likely that it's still curious,
competitive, greedy and expansionist. The next reasonable step towards transitioning to Type 2
is trying to alter and mine other planets and bodies. This might start with outposts in space,
transition to infrastructure and industries near the home planet, move on to colonies,
and end with terraforming other planets, by changing their atmosphere,
their rotation, or position. As a civilization expands and
uses more and more stuff and space, its energy consumption scales with them, so at some point, they may embark on the largest project
a lower Type 2 civilization can take on: harnessing the energy of their star
by building a Dyson Swarm. Once this megastructure is finished, energy has become practically unlimited
for molding the home system however they see fit. If they are still curious, competitive,
greedy and expansionist, and now have complete control
over their home system, stellar infrastructure in place,
and the energy output of a star, the next frontier moves to
other stars light years away. For a Type 2 civilization, the distance to other stars might feel like
the distance between Earth and Pluto does to us today: Technically within reach, but only with immense investments
in terms of time, ingenuity, and resources. This begins their transition
towards Type 3. This step is so far beyond us that it becomes hard to imagine
what exactly these challenges will look like, and how they'll be solved. Will they be able to find a solution
to the vast distances and travel times of
hundreds or thousands of years? Will they be able to communicate and keep a shared
culture and biology between colonies light years apart? Or will they split into
separate Type 2 civilizations? Maybe even different species? Are there deadly challenges between the stars? So the closer a species gets to Type 3, the harder it becomes to fathom
what it might actually look like. They might discover new physics,
may understand and control dark matter and energy, or be able to travel faster than light. We might be unable to grasp their
motives, technology, and actions. Humans are the ants, trying to
understand the galactic metropolitan area. A high Type 2 civilization might already consider
humanity too primitive to even talk to. A Type 3 civilization might feel about
as like we feel about the bacteria living on the anthill. Maybe they wouldn't even consider us conscious,
or our survival relevant. We could only pray that they're nice gods. But the scale doesn't necessarily end here. Some scientists suggest there might be
Type 4 and Type 5 civilizations, whose influence stretches over
galaxy clusters or superclusters, structures comprising thousands of galaxies
and trillions of stars. Ultimately, there might be
a Type Omega civilization, able to manipulate the entire universe,
and possibly others. Type omega civilizations might be
the actual creators of our universe, for reasons beyond our comprehension. Maybe they were just bored. As flawed as this classification may be, this thought experiment is
already telling us interesting things. If our ideas about the nature of species that
form interstellar civilizations is sort of correct, then we can be pretty sure that there are
no civilizations of Type 3 and beyond near the Milky Way. Their influence would in all likelihood
be so all-encompassing, and their technology so far above our own,
that we couldn't miss them. The galaxy should flash with their activity
in thousands of star systems. We should be able to see or detect their artifacts or movements
between different parts of their empire. Even if a Type 3 civilization did exist in the past,
and died a mysterious death, we should be able to detect
some of the remnants of their empire. But when scientists looked,
they didn't find remnants of harvested stars, decaying megastructures
or scars of great interstellar wars. So they're very likely not out there
and never were. In a sense, this is very sad,
but also very reassuring. It leaves the galaxy to us and
others similar to us. So the most promising civilizations to look for may be
somewhere in the spectrum from Type 1.5 to Type 2.5. They wouldn't be too advanced to
understand them and their motives. They may have finished their first megastructures, and they might be in the process of
moving staff between stars, transmitting enormous amounts of information
into space, by accident, or on purpose. They would probably also look to the stars
and look for others. Then again, maybe we've got it all wrong. Maybe progress to Type 2
does not mean expanding outwards, and humanity is still too immature
to imagine otherwise. For now, all we really know is that
we haven't seen anybody yet. But, we've only just started looking."
ck4RGeoHFko,2020-07-12T12:30:23.000000,What Is Intelligence? Where Does it Begin?,"Humans are proud of a lot of things, from particle accelerators to poetry to Pokemon. All of them made possible because of something humans value extremely highly: Intelligence. We think of intelligence as a trait like height or strength, but when we try to define it, things get fuzzy. In a nutshell, intelligence is a mechanism to solve problems. Especially the problem of staying alive, which involves finding food and shelter, fighting sexual competitors, or fleeing from predators. Intelligence is not a single thing; it includes the ability to gather knowledge, to learn, be creative, form strategies, or engage in critical thinking. It manifests itself in a huge variety of behaviors. From hardwired or instinct like reactions to different degrees of learning, to some sort of awareness. But not all scientists agree where it begins or what even should count as intelligence. To make this even more complicated, intelligence is also connected to consciousness since awareness is helpful for problem-solving. But we're exploring consciousness in other videos, so today we'll leave it aside. Okay, Intelligence isn't exactly clear-cut, so maybe we can think of it as more like a flexible set of skills: A toolbox. Basic tools. The most basic tools in the intelligence toolbox are the ability to gather information, to save it, and to use it to learn. Information about the world is gathered through senses such as vision, sound, smell, touch or taste, and helps us navigate and react to the external world appropriately. But living things also need to keep track of the state of their own bodies, monitoring things like hunger and fatigue. Information is the basis of action for all living things, and without it, you're at the mercy of your surroundings, unable to react appropriately, or flexibly. Information is much more powerful if we can keep and save it, so the second tool is memory. Memory is the ability to save and recall information, so a living being doesn't have to start from scratch every time it perceives something relevant. Memories can be about events, places, and associations, but also behaviors like hunting or foraging methods. Some of these, like flying, have to be repeated over and over until they're mastered. This is what we call learning, the process of putting together a sequence of thoughts or actions. Basically a string of repeatable behaviors that can be varied and adapted. These three tools enable seemingly stupid creatures to act in surprisingly intelligent ways. The acellular slime mold, which is basically just a single huge slimy cell, shows behavior similar to an animal with a simple brain. When put in a maze with food at one end, the slime mold explores its surroundings, and marks its path with slime trails, sort of, smearing memories on the ground. As it continues exploring, it avoids the marked pathways and finds its way to the food. Instead of blindly getting stuck in dead-ends, the slime mold adapts its behavior to save time and effort. This behavior is hardwired, and scientists can't agree if that's intelligent, although it does give the slime mold a certain advantage. Bees are an example of more adaptive smart behavior. Scientists trained bumblebees to move a colored ball into a goal post for a sugar reward. Not only were the bees very skillful at this behaviour, which isn't natural to them, they got more efficient over time. When several balls were available, bees chose the ball that lay closest to the goal, even if it was a different color than the ball they were trained with. For more challenging problems, we need even more flexibility: Fancier tools. Building on the basic tools, more complex animals have a wider range of problems they can solve. They can memorize all kinds of associations, connections, and mechanical tricks. We'll call this tool “The Library of Knowledge”. Take raccoons. Their favorite kind of food is human food. Their approach to getting hold of such treats depends upon an assortment of theoretical and practical skills, that makes them master burglars, able to open windows or pick locks. In a study, raccoons were given boxes secured with different kinds of locks, like latches, bolts, plugs, or push bars. They needed less than 10 attempts to figure out how to open each box. Even when different locks were put together into increasingly difficult combinations that had to be solved in the right order, and with different amounts of strength. A year later, the raccoons still remembered how to open the boxes, and were as fast as when they had first solved the puzzle. Beyond our library of associations and skills, the most impressive tool in our box is creativity, a sort of mental duct tape. Being creative means producing something new and valuable from apparently unrelated things. In the context of intelligence this means making new and unusual connections. Pairing input with memories and skills, to come up with a unique solution to a problem. In another raccoon study, researchers showed the animals that by dropping pebbles into a water tank, they could raise the water level enough to reach a marshmallow floating at the top. One raccoon came up with a much better solution: it tipped the tub over. Another facet of creativity is applying a new resource to a task: Physical tools. Like primates that use sticks to fish for termites in trees, or some octopuses, which assemble collected coconut shells around themselves as a sort of portable armor to hide from enemies. Collecting materials for later use is connected to an even more advanced dimension of problem-solving: Planning. Planning means considering the activities required for a desired goal and putting them together in a plan. When unforeseen circumstances and new possibilities present themselves, they need to be assessed according to whether they match the plan or not. An example of this intelligent behavior is hoarding food to eat it later. This is an instinctive behavior in squirrels. But even though hiding food comes instinctively to them, they still need to use advanced thinking skills to make the best decisions. Squirrels examine every nut and weigh the time and effort it would take to hide it, against the benefits they would get from each one. Damaged or low-fat nuts are eaten right away, while nuts that still need to ripen go on the stockpile. Squirrels also pretend to bury nuts when they feel watched. These empty caches distract rivals from their real treasure. This is pretty advanced strategizing because to make a plan to distract someone else, you first have to be aware that there are others like you that want the same things. The more complex the problem, the more tools are needed in combination to solve it. So the more tools there are, the more flexibility a being has to solve the challenges life throws at them. But even for complex problems, each animal's individual situation is what counts. Squirrels are omnivores that defend their territories fiercely. For them, it makes sense to remember where there's food in different locations and trick their enemies to improve their chances of survival. Sheep don't have any such refined tricks up their sleeve, but they don't need to. They are grazers and live in flocks. The skills relevant to them are social. They recognize and remember many different sheep, and even humans for years; a completely different skill. Evolving and retaining a complex set of mental abilities they might never use would be a waste of resources for them. Humans went the opposite way and invested in an unusually diverse intelligence toolkit. While this was helpful, by accident we added another set of tools on top: Culture. No single person could ever build a space rocket or particle accelerator. But thanks to our ability to work together and to share knowledge across generations, we can overcome challenges beyond any single individual's ability. This allowed us to shape the planet to our liking. We also created new problems in the process: sudoku, tax forms, string theory. But also rapid climate change and antibiotic resistance. To solve these, we'll need to look past short-term survival and think about the distant future. We have the toolbox, we just need to use it. Speaking of tools for learning, we've heard from many teachers that are using our infographic posters in class. So we asked what would help them the most and made an education edition for teachers, students, and everyone else. They're slightly larger posters about various things that we'll expand over time. From a periodic table, to a world map or the human body. You can get them in our shop and support us if you want. And let us know which poster topics you want for your room or classroom.

ipVxxxqwBQw,2020-06-21T12:29:44.000000,Who Is Responsible For Climate Change? – Who Needs To Fix It?,"Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have released over 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide or CO₂, into the Earth's atmosphere. In the year 2019, we were still pumping out around 37 billion more. That's 50 percent more than the year 2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago. And it's not just CO₂, we're also pumping out growing volumes of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. Combining all of our greenhouse gases, we're emitting 51 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalents each year. And emissions keep rising. But they need to get down to zero. In recent years, the consequences have become more serious and visible. Almost every year breaks some horrible record: We've had more heat waves, the most glaciers melting, and the lowest amount of ice ever recorded at the North Pole. Of the last 22 years, 20 have been the hottest on record. The only way to limit this rapid climate change is to decrease our collective emissions quickly. But although all countries agree on this goal in principle, they do not agree who is responsible or who should bear the heaviest load. The developed countries point at their own efforts to reduce emissions and the fact that the large developing countries on the rise, especially China, are currently releasing much more CO₂. On the other hand, developing countries argue that emissions by the West are lifestyle emissions, while for developing countries, they are survival emissions. Others call rich countries hypocrites that got rich by polluting without restraint and now expect others not to industrialize and stay poor. So who is responsible for climate change and CO₂ emissions? And regardless of the past, who needs to do the most today? In this video, we'll talk exclusively about nation-states. We'll look at the fossil fuel industry in another video. Question 1 of 3: Which countries emit the most carbon dioxide today? In 2017, humans emitted about 36 billion tons of CO₂. More than 50% came from Asia. North America and Europe followed with 18% and 17%. While Africa, South America, and Oceania together only contributed eight percent. China is by far the world's largest emitter with 10 billion tons of CO₂ every year, or 27% of global emissions. It's followed by the USA with 15% and the European Union with around 10%. Together, this is more than half of the world's CO₂ emissions. So it's clear that without the willingness and action of these three industrial blocs, humanity will not be able to become carbon neutral and prevent severe climate change. Next on our list is India at seven percent, Russia at five percent, Japan at three percent, and Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Canada all just short of two percent. Together with the first three, the top 10 are responsible for 75% of global emissions. But if we only look at the current situation, we're not getting the full picture. Question 2 of 3: Which countries have emitted the most in total? If we look at emissions throughout history until today, the outlook changes drastically. The US and the EU both knock China off the top spot. The US is responsible for 25% of the world's historical emissions emitting 400 billion tons, mostly in the 20ᵗʰ century. In second place is the EU at 22%. China comes in third at just under 13 percent, around half of the USA's contribution. India's contribution shrinks to 3 percent along with the whole of Africa and South America. The UK is responsible for one percent of annual global emissions but takes five percent of the historical responsibility. Germany, producing two percent of emissions per year today, has contributed almost six percent, as much as the whole of Africa and South America combined. So the narrative that rapid climate change is really the responsibility of the developing world is hard to defend if facts matter to you. But this is still not the whole story, because focusing on countries mixes two things: population numbers and total emissions. If a country has more people in general, its emissions are of course higher. Things look very different if we look at individuals like you, dear viewer. Question 3 of 3: Which countries emit the most carbon dioxide per person? The average human is responsible for around five tons of CO₂ each year, but averages can be misleading. The countries with the largest CO₂ emissions per person are some of the world's major oil and gas producers. In 2017, Qatar had the highest emissions at a hefty 49 tons per person, followed by Trinidad and Tobago, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Brunei, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. But those are outliers. Australians have one of the highest carbon footprints per person: 17 tons a year. That's more than triple the global average and slightly more than the average US American and Canadian at 16 tons. The Germans do a little better at close to 10 tons, but this is still twice the global average. China may be the world's largest emitter, but it's also the world's most populous country with over 1.4 billion people, 18.5% of the world population. Per person, it's above average at seven tons. Historically, CO₂ emissions have been closely tied to a high standard of living. Wealth is one of the strongest indicators of our carbon footprint, because as we move from poor to rich, we gain access to electricity, heating, air conditioning, lighting, modern cooking, cars or planes, smartphones, computers, and interact with people across the world online. The enormous rise of China's CO₂ emissions is coupled with the greatest reduction of poverty in history. If we order CO₂ emissions by income, we see that the richest half of countries are responsible for 86% of global emissions and the bottom half for only 14%. The average German emits more than five times as much as the average Indian. In just 2.3 days, the average American emits as much as the average Nigerian in a year. And not only that, the harsh reality is that it's the countries that contribute least to the problem that stand to lose the most from rapid climate change. The developing world will be hit the hardest. The consequences could be food insecurity, conflicts over resources, harsher and more frequent natural disasters, and large climate refugee movements. Question 4... of 3: So who should take responsibility? Many of today's richest countries are in a convenient position. They have become rich over centuries of fossil fuel burning and industrial production. They have a large historical footprint, and their wealth means they still emit a lot per person. But their country's annual emissions are now dwarfed by other countries, because the giant that is China is finally catching up, and other giants like India are on their way. Many Germans, for example, wonder how if Germany only accounts for two percent of yearly emissions, it can have a meaningful impact on reducing emissions. The answer is simple. For one, the richest countries have the resources, highly educated workforces, and technology to develop low-cost, low-carbon solutions and spread them around the world. If we don't want poorer countries to become as fossil fuel-dependent as we are, we need low-carbon technology to be cheap and available. And we're getting there. The cost of renewables is falling quickly and a variety of solutions are on the horizon for many different sectors. But it needs to happen much faster. If the rich countries of the West decide to seriously tackle rapid climate change, the rest of the world would follow, because it has no choice. Just like when the European Union enforced energy efficiency standards for technology, the rest of the world adopted them too, because they wanted to be able to continue trading with the block. Still, this doesn't absolve others of their responsibility. China is the largest CO₂ emitter today, and it's China's responsibility to grow in a way that will make it possible to transition to a zero-carbon world in time. Others acting irresponsibly yesterday is a horrible excuse for repeating the same mistakes today. Climate change is a global problem, and no country alone can fix it. Working out who's responsible is not as simple as it seems, and in a way, it's a daft question, but one that has plagued international politics for decades. In the end, it's pretty simple. Everybody needs to do the best they can, and right now we are all not doing that. But we can begin today. This video is part of a series about climate change supported by Breakthrough Energy, a coalition founded by Bill Gates that's working to expand clean energy investment and support the innovations that will lead the world to net zero carbon emissions.

and plasma in random directions. These solar flares and coronal
mass ejections, or CMEs, can hit Earth and have serious
consequences for humanity. How exactly do they work? How bad could they be? And can we prepare for them? [Intro music] While the Sun seems pretty solid,
it's actually like a very hot ocean. So hot that it rips atoms into electrons and nuclei,
all flowing around each other in a plasma. This plasma is pushed around and
shaped by the Sun's magnetic field. Similar to how the Sun's gravitational field reaches
out to the planets and shapes their orbits. But magnetism is very different from gravity. Magnetism is one part of a dual force: 
Electromagnetism. Electricity creates magnetic fields,
and magnetic fields create electricity. On the Sun, the plasma—made of electrically
charged protons and electrons— creates a magnetic field as they move, and this magnetic field then
shapes the flow of particles. They're stuck in a dynamic
feedback loop called a dynamo, which keeps the sun's
magnetic field alive. This magnetic field stores
enormous amounts of energy and leaks out over the Solar System. It carries with it a constant trickle of solar plasma,
like a light rain, known as the solar wind, creating a sort of space weather. But it isn't always calm and smooth. As the sun's plasma churns
and flows around itself, its magnetic field gets
all kinked and twisted. This creates magnetic knots that
build up enormous amounts of energy. When the magnetic knots break—like a
tangle of springs exploding outwards— the Sun can vomit plasma and other
awful things into the Solar System. These solar storms come in many types, like solar flares; a tidal wave
of high-energy radiation. They race through the solar system at the speed
of light, sweeping up protons in the solar wind, accelerating them into a
high-speed solar-proton storm. Then, there are coronal mass ejections, which rip millions or billions of tons
of plasma from the Sun's atmosphere, catapulting it through the solar system at
speeds of up to 9 million km/h. When these monsters hit us,
nothing happens on Earth. While even smaller storms
can damage satellites, affect radio communication, or be dangerous to astronauts, for people on the surface,
space weather is harmless. Earth's atmosphere protects us from
the worst effects of a solar flare by absorbing the blast of X-rays
high up in the atmosphere, well before it reaches the surface. The electrified plasma from a CME is
deflected by the Earth's magnetic field, diverting the energy storm to
the North and South Poles, where energetic particles
fall into the atmosphere, causing the atmosphere to glow
and creating beautiful auroras. As with any sort of weather—
most of the time, things are fine. Sometimes, there are hurricanes, though. Or in the case of the Sun,
solar superstorms. And we know that they happen
once or twice every century. If one were to happen today, we
would first detect strong solar flares, a sort of flash before the much
more dangerous thunder. The thunder is a CME, consisting of
billions of tons of hot magnetic plasma that crosses the 150 million kilometers
between the Sun and Earth in less than a day. When it arrives, it causes a shockwave that
violently compresses the Earth's magnetic field and transfers energy into
the magnetosphere. But it can get worse. If the magnetic field of the CME is
aligned to Earth's in just the right way, the two magnetic fields merge. As the magnetic cloud passes over Earth,
it stretches the Earth's field into a long tail. Eventually, the energy stored in the
tail becomes too much to contain. It snaps and explosively releases
its energy towards Earth. A geomagnetic storm has begun. A few hundred years ago,
nobody would have cared. This storm gushing over the Earth is not relevant
for machines made out of meat and bones. But it's very relevant for machines
made out of metal and wire. Remember the dynamo? Magnetism creates electric currents. Earth in the 21st century is covered in millions
of kilometers of wires, transporting electricity, and a complex grid of machines, like
transformers, that make this transfer possible. A CME's energy can induce currents in our power
grid that can either completely shut it down, or worse, destroy the transformer
stations that keep our grid running. This has happened already, like when the Quebec power grid failed
after a strong solar storm in 1989. But in general, our engineers know
how to deal with these storms, and so we usually don't even notice. The last time a solar hurricane
washed over Earth was in 1859: The Carrington Event, the largest geomagnetic storms
ever observed on Earth. Massive auroras occurred
as far south as the Caribbean. In some places, they were
so bright that people got up, thinking the Sun was rising. Luckily, we only had one
sort of modern technology: telegraph systems. They failed all over the world, shocking their operators
and chucking out sparks. Today, we have a tad more technology, and our luck may run out soon. Another bad solar storm is
bound to happen eventually. A storm as strong as the Carrington Event
missed earth only by a small margin in 2012. Studies projected that it would've inflicted
serious damage to electronic systems globally, costing up to $2.6 trillion to the US alone. The time to replace all the damaged systems
was estimated at between 4 and 10 years. It's hard to say how bad
it could have been. Experts disagreed. Some assumed there would
just be temporary blackouts, but others worried it
could be much worse. We won't know for sure until
a big solar hurricane hits us. The probability of such an event is
estimated to be 12% per decade. That's about a 50/50 chance of
at least one in the next 50 years. And, there is more unsettling news. A 2019 paper found that
even calm stars, like our Sun, can create superflares
every few thousand years. Eruptions orders of magnitude
stronger than the strongest storms we have observed in the Solar System. If such a storm hits us unprepared, the
consequences could be catastrophic. It's hard to overstate how much
we depend on electricity. It's not just the lights at home. It means no computers, no communication, no navigation. A sustained power outage might lead
to a breakdown of the supply chain, water supply systems failing and hospital generators running dry, supermarkets not being refilled while food rots in the fields. The lack of power might make it extremely
hard to reboot our broken power grid, taking years or decades to
restart our starving civilization. Okay, time to panic? As much as daily newspapers might like for
solar storms to send us back to the Stone Age, they probably won't. Fortunately, even though solar
storms aren't preventable, virtually all of their nasty side effects are. Scientists observing the Sun have a few hours
up to a few days to see a CME coming. And the engineers working the
systems that keep the world running are well aware of the risks
posed by solar storms. Transformers and substations
can be taken offline— short preventative blackouts— or in other words, by unplugging stuff. Engineers can open up extra lines
to dissipate the extra power. And with investment and upgrades cheap
compared to those other natural disasters require, we could protect the world's electric grid
against even the nastiest of storms. But we do need to prepare. While the risk is manageable, it is real. For while our Sun bathes us
in warm and pleasant light, one day, it might send a monster our way that we better be ready for."
YbgnlkJPga4,2020-05-24T12:29:32.000000,The Past We Can Never Return To – The Anthropocene Reviewed,"Today we're doing something different. Our friend John Green will read a story from his podcast, ""The Anthropocene Reviewed"". We hope you enjoy it and we'll be back with a regular video, Soon. So if you've ever been or had a child, you will likely already be familiar with hand stencils. They were the first figurative art made by both our kids somewhere between the ages of 2 and 3. My children spread the fingers of one hand out across a piece of paper, and then with the help of a parent, traced their five fingers. I remember my son's face as he lifted his hand and looked absolutely shocked to see the shape of his hand still on the paper - a semi permanent record of himself. I am extremely happy that my children are no longer 3 and yet to look at their little hands from those early artworks is to be inundated with a strange, soul splitting joy. Those pictures remind me that they are not just growing up, but also growing away from me, running toward their own lives. But of course that's meaning I am applying to their hand stencils and that complicated relationship between art and its viewers is never more fraught than when we are looking deeply into the past. In September of 1940, an 18 year old mechanic named Marcel Ravidat was walking his dog Robot in the countryside of southwestern France, when the dog disappeared down a hole. Robot eventually returned, but the next day Ravidat went to the spot with three friends to explore the hole and after quite a bit of digging they discovered a cave with walls covered with paintings, including over 900 paintings of animals: horses, stags, bison and also species that are now extinct, including a woolly rhinoceros. The paintings were astonishingly detailed and vivid with red, yellow and black paint made from pulverized mineral pigments that were usually blown through a narrow tube, possibly a hollowed bone, unto the walls of the cave. It would eventually be established that these artworks were at least 17,000 years old. Two of the boys who visited the cave that day were so profoundly moved by the art they saw, that they camped outside the cave to protect it for over a year. After World War II the French government took over protection of the site and the cave was open to the public in 1948. When Picasso saw the cave paintings on a visit that year he reportedly said, ''We have invented nothing.'' There are many mysteries at Lascaux. Why, for instance, are there no paintings of reindeer, which we know were the primary source of food for the Paleolithic humans who lived in that cave? Why were they so much more focused on painting animals than painting human forms? Why are certain areas of the cave filled with images, including pictures on the ceiling that required the building of scaffolding to create, while other areas have only a few paintings? And were the paintings spiritual -- ""here are our sacred animals""? Or were they practical -- ""Here is a guide to some of the animals that might kill you""? Aside from the animals, there are nearly a thousand abstract signs and shapes we cannot interpret, and also several ""negative hand stencils"" as they are known by art historians. These are the paintings that most interest me. They were created by pressing one hand with fingers splayed against the wall of the cave and then blowing pigment, leaving the area around the hand painted. Similar hand stencils have been found in caves around the world, from Indonesia to Spain to Australia to the Americas to Africa. We have found these memories of hands from 15 or 30 or even 40 thousand years ago. These hand stencils remind us of how different life was in the distant past. Amputations likely from frostbite are common in Europe. And so you often see negative hand stencils with three or four fingers. And life was short and difficult. As many as a quarter of women died in childbirth; around 50% of children died before the age of five. But they also remind us that the humans of the past were as human as we are. Their hands indistinguishable from ours. These communities hunted and gathered and there were no large caloric surpluses. So every healthy person would have had to contribute to the acquisition of food and water, and yet somehow they still made time to create art. Almost as if art isn't optional for humans. We see all kinds of hands stenciled on cave walls, children and adults, but almost always the fingers are spread. Like my kids' hand stencils. I'm no Jungian. But it's fascinating and a little strange that so many Paleolithic humans, who couldn't possibly have had any contact with each other, created the same paintings the same way -- paintings that we are still making. But then again, what the Lascaux art means to me is likely very different from what it meant to the people who made it. Some academics theorized that the hand stencils were part of hunting rituals. Then there's always the possibility that the hand was just a convenient model situated at the end of the wrist. To me, though, the hand stencils at Lascaux say, ""I was here."" They say, ""You are not new."" And because they are negative prints surrounded by red pigment, they also looked to me like something out of a horror movie. Like ghostly hands reaching up from some bloody background. They remind me that, as Alice Walker wrote, ""All history is current."" The Lascaux cave has been closed to the public for many years now. Too many contemporary humans breathing inside of it led to the growth of mold and lichens, which has damaged some of the art. Just the act of looking at something can ruin it, I guess. But tourists can still visit an imitation cave called Lascaux II, in which the artwork has been meticulously recreated. Humans making fake cave art to save real cave art may feel like peak Anthropocene behavior. But I have to confess that even though I am a jaded and cynical semi-professional reviewer of human activity, I actually find it overwhelmingly hopeful, that four teenagers and a dog named Robot discovered a cave with 17,000-year-old handprints, that the cave was so overwhelmingly beautiful that two of those teenagers devoted themselves to its protection. And that when we humans became a danger to that caves' beauty, we agreed to stop going. Lascaux is there. You cannot visit. You can go to the fake cave we've built, and see nearly identical hand stencils. But you will know this is not the thing itself, but a shadow of it. This is a handprint, but not a hand. This is a memory that you cannot return to. All of which makes the cave very much like the past it represents. We hope you enjoyed this video even if it was different.

QImCld9YubE,2020-05-10T12:30:08.000000,"Why Are You Alive – Life, Energy & ATP","At this very second, you are on
a narrow ledge between life and death. You probably don't feel it, but there's
an incredible amount of activity going on inside you, and this activity can never stop. Picture yourself as a Slinky falling down 
an escalator moving upwards. The falling part represents the self-replicating processes of your cells. The escalator represents the laws of physics driving you forwards. To be alive is to be in motion but never arriving anywhere. If you reach the top of the escalator, there's no more falling possible, and you are dead forever. Somewhat unsettlingly, the universe wants you to reach the top. How do you avoid that? And why are you alive? [Amazing-sounding Kurz Intro Music] All life is based on the cell. A cell is a piece of the dead universe that separated itself from the rest so it could do its own thing for a while. When this separation breaks down, it dies and joins the rest of the dead universe again. Unfortunately, the universe would like for life to be done with doing its own thing. For some reason, it's not a fan of exciting things, but tries to be as boring as possible. We call this principle ""entropy,"" and it's a fundamental rule of our universe. It's pretty complicated and counterintuitive, so we'll explain it in detail in another video. For now, all you need to know is living things are inherently exciting. A cell is filled up with millions of proteins and millions more simpler molecules like water. Thousands of complex, self-replicating processes are happening up to hundreds of thousands of times every second. To stay alive and exciting, it has to constantly work to keep itself from achieving entropy and becoming boring and dead. The cell has to maintain a separation from the rest of the universe. It's doing this, for example, by keeping the concentration of certain molecules different on the inside and the outside by actively pumping out excess molecules. To do stuff like this, a cell needs energy. Energy is the ability of things in the universe to do work; to move or manipulate a thing; to create change. This ability cannot be created or destroyed. The set amount of energy in the universe will never change. We don't know why, it just is that way. So, billions of years ago, one of the most crucial challenges for the first living beings was to get usable energy. We don't know a lot about the first cells, except that they got their energy from simple chemical reactions. And they found the ultimate energy transfer system: the energetic building block of life. The molecule Adenosine Triphosphate, or ATP. Its structure makes it uniquely good at accepting and releasing energy. When a cell needs energy, for example, to pump out molecules or to repair a broken micro machine, it can break down ATP, and use the chemical energy to do work and create change. This is why living beings are able to do stuff. We don't know when or how exactly the first ATP molecule was made on earth. But every living thing we know uses ATP, or something very similar, to keep its internal machinery running. It's crucial for almost every process. Plants, fungi, bacteria, and animals need to survive. Without ATP, no life on Earth. Possibly anywhere. While breaking down chemicals for energy is nice and all, early life did miss out on the greatest available source of energy: The Sun. The Sun merges atoms and radiates photons away that carry energy into the solar system. But this energy is raw and indigestible. It needs to be refined. After hundreds of millions of years of evolution, finally, a cell figured out how to eat the Sun. It absorbed radiation and converted much of it into neat little chemical packages that it could use to stay alive. We call this process: Photosynthesis. You take photons that are wobbly with electromagnetic energy, and use a part of this energy to merge and combine different molecules together. The electromagnetic energy is converted into chemical energy stored in the ATP molecule. This process became even better, as some cells learned to create better chemical packages: Glucose, or sugar. Easy to break down, high in energy, and pretty tasty. This is so convenient, that some cells decided that instead of doing all that pesky photosynthesis work themselves, they would just swallow other cells that did, and take their glucose and ATP. This is widely considered one of the biggest anime betrayals in evolutionary history. And so things went on. Photosynthesizing cells could mostly harness energy at their surfaces, which limited their maximum energy production, which limited their evolutionary avenues somewhat. So, time passed. Some cells made sugar, others ate them. Evolution did its thing, but overall things stayed pretty much the same for hundreds of millions of years. Until, one day, a cell ate another, and did not kill it. Instead, they became one cell. Nothing had changed that day, but Earth would be different forever. This cell became the ancestor of all animals on this planet. Blue whales, amoeba. Dinosaurs, jellyfish. Pink fairy armadillos, and Sunda colugos. And of course, you. All can trace back their existence to this moment. The merging of two living beings is so important, because when those two cells became one, they became way more powerful. The formerly independent cell in the inside, could stop trying to survive. It could concentrate on one thing: make ATP. It became the powerhouse of the cell: the first mitochondria. The host cell's job became to ensure survival in the dangerous world, and provide the mitochondria with food. Mitochondria basically reverse photosynthesis, in a similarly complex process. They take sugar molecules that we got from eating other living things, combust them with oxygen and precursor molecules, to make new, energy-rich ATP molecules. This process works like a tiny furnace and spits out waste products like CO2, water, and a little bit of kinetic energy that you experience as body heat. This first division of labor, meant the new cell had way more energy available than any cell before, which meant more possibilities for evolution to enable more complex cells. At some point, these cells began to form small groups or communities, which lead to multicellular life, and finally, to you. Today, you are a pile of trillions of cells, each filled with dozens, if not hundreds of little machines that provides you with usable energy to stay alive. If this process is interrupted, even for a few minutes, you die. (Teaser of Kurzgesagt: Science War, coming in 2021.) But if life is so fragile, wouldn't it be a good idea to store ATP, like we store sugar in our fat cells, so we don't die if we stop breathing for a while? If life has solved so many problems to make you live today, what's up with the dying quickly thing? Even simple bacteria like E. Coli make about 50 times their body weight in ATP for every cell division. Your trillions of cells need a lot of ATP to keep you around. Every day, your body produces and converts about 90 million, billion, billion molecules of ATP: about your own body weight. You need a whole person's worth of ATP just to make it through a single day. Even storing enough ATP to last you a few minutes is basically impossible. An ATP molecule is really good for shifting energy around quickly, but it's terrible for storage, since it has only one percent of a glucose molecule's energy at three times its mass. So ATP is constantly produced and used up fairly quickly. This was the short and simplified story of the molecule that allows you to be different from the dead universe, and to be the slinky on the escalator. It is a weird story. There is this molecule you need to survive at all times. You need it to keep moving, because even a short break brings your slinky to a stop. And you need to make it yourself. It's like driving a car at full speed while producing fuel in the trunk with junk that you pick up from the side of the road. As far as we know, this all began billions of years ago, when tiny parts of the dead universe came together and became something else for a moment. It could keep itself going. It could grow. That moment set the slinky in motion, and it's been going ever since. From the very first cells, to you watching this now. At some point, you will merge with the rest of the dead universe again. Maybe you'll tell it stories about your adventures. Maybe not. But before you find out, you get to do what life does best. Making a dead universe, much more interesting. (With a Supreme Slinky poster in your room.) *Quack* Duck: Why am I floating with no purpose in this universe?"
BtN-goy9VOY,2020-03-19T15:37:18.000000,The Coronavirus Explained & What You Should Do,"In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities. In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 that causes the disease called Covid-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus. What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do? [Intro Music] A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not even a living thing. It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell. Corona may spread via surfaces, but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them. Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection when people cough, or if you touch someone who's ill and then your face, say rubbing your eyes or nose. The virus starts its journey here, and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into the body Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic effect. Even just a few corona viruses can cause quite a dramatic situation. The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells. These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa waiting to be infected. Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victim's membranes to inject its genetic material. The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple: copy and reassemble. It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical point and receives one final order, self-destruct. The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles ready to attack more cells. The number of infected cells grows exponentially After about 10 days, millions of body cells are infected, and billions of viruses swarmed the lungs. The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real beast on you, your own immune system. The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself and needs tight regulation. And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, Corona infects some of them and creates confusion. Cells have neither ears nor eyes. They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines. Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them. Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder. In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage. Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc. First, neutrophils, which are great at killing stuff, including our cells. As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends as enemies. The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T-cells, which usually order infected cells to commit controlled suicide. Confused as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too. The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy lung tissue they kill. This might get so bad that it can cause permanent irreversible damage, that leads to lifelong disabilities. In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control. It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones and cleans up the battlefield. Recovery begins. The majority of people infected by Corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms. But many cases become severe or even critical. We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified, but it's safe to say that there is a lot more than with the flu. In more severe cases, Millions of epithelial cells have died and with them, the lungs' protective lining is gone. That means that the alveoli - tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs - can be infected by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem. Patients get pneumonia. Respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators to survive. The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons. And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed. They enter the blood and overrun the body; if this happens, death is very likely. The Corona virus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it's much more dangerous. While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic, we know for sure that it's much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu. There are two futures for a pandemic like Corona: fast and slow. Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak. A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives; a slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books. The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection because there are no counter measures in place to slow it down. Why is this so bad? In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time. If the numbers get too large, health care systems become unable to handle it. There aren't enough resources, like medical staff or equipment like ventilators, left to help everybody. People will die untreated. And as more health care workers get sick themselves, the capacity of health care systems falls even further. If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live and who doesn't. The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario. To avoid this, the world - that means all of us - needs to do what it can to turn this into a slow pandemic. A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses. Especially in the early phase, so that everyone who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals. Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona, we have to socially engineer our behaviour, to act like a social vaccine. This simply means two things: 1. Not getting infected; and 2. Not infecting others. Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands. The soap is actually a powerful tool. The corona virus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat; soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you. It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses are ripped away. To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeños and want to put in your contact lenses next. The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience, but a nice thing to do. This means: no hugging, no handshakes. If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function: from doctors to cashiers, or police officers;. You depend on all of them; they all depend on you to not get sick. On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things, from travel restrictions or actual orders to stay at home. Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular. But they buy us - and specially the researchers working on medication and vaccinations - crucial time So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why, and respect it. None of this is fun. But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay. The question of how pandemics end, depends on how they start; if they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly. If they start slow, with a not-so-steep slope, they end okay-ish. And, in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands. Literally, and figuratively. A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with this video, specially Our World In Data, the online publication for research and data on the world's largest problems and how to make progress solving them.

1AElONvi9WQ,2020-03-01T13:30:00.000000,Why Blue Whales Don't Get Cancer - Peto&#39;s Paradox,"Cancer is a creepy and mysterious thing. In the process of trying to understand it, to get better at killing it, we discovered a biological paradox
that remains unsolved to this day: Large animals seem to be immune to cancer, which doesn't make any sense. The bigger a being, the more cancer it should have. To understand why we first need to
take a look at the nature of cancer itself. (Kurzgesagt intro music) Kurzgesagt in a Nutshell Our cells are protein robots made out
of hundreds of millions of parts. Guided only by chemical reactions, they create and dismantle structures, sustain a metabolism to gain energy, or make *almost* perfect copies of themselves. We call these complex chemical reactions pathways. They are biochemical networks upon networks,
intertwined and stacked on top of each other. Most of them can barely be comprehended by
a single human mind and yet they functioned perfectly... Until.. they don't. With billions of trillions of reactions happening
in thousands of networks over many years, The question is not *if* something
will go wrong, but when. Tiny mistakes add up until the
grandiose machinery gets corrupted. To prevent this from getting out of hand, our cells have kill switches that
make them commit suicide. But these kill switches are not infallible. If they fail, a cell can turn into a cancer cell. Most of them are slained by
the immune system very quickly. But this is a numbers game. Given enough time a cell would accrue enough mistakes, slipped by unnoticed and begin making more of itself. All animals have to deal with this problem. In general the cells of different
animals are the same size. The cells of a mouse aren't smaller than yours.
It just has fewer cells in total and a shorter lifespan. Fewer cells and a short life means a lower chance
of things going wrong or cells mutating, or at least it should mean that. Humans live about 50 times longer and
have 3!,000 times more cells than mice, yet the rate of cancer is basically
the same in humans and in mice. Even waiter, blue whales with about 3,000 times more cells than humans don't seem to get cancer at all really. This is PETO'S PARADOX: The baffling realization that large animals
have much much less cancer than they should. Scientists think there are two main ways of
explaining the paradox; evolution and hyper tumors. Solution one: evolve or become a blob of cancer. As multicellular beings
developed a 600 million years ago, animals became bigger and bigger. Which added more and more cells and hence more
and more chances that cells could be corrupted. So the collective had to invest
in better and better cancer defenses. The ones that did not died out. But cancer doesn't just happen. It's a process that involves many individual mistakes and mutations in several specific genes within the same cell. These genes are called proto-oncogenes
and when they mutate it's bad news. For example with the right mutation,
a cell will lose its ability to kill itself. Another mutation and it will develop the ability to hide. Another and it will send out calls for resources. Another one and it will multiply quickly. These oncogenes have an antagonist though; tumor suppressor genes. They prevent these critical mutations from happening or order the cell to kill itself if they decide it's beyond repair. It turns out that large animals
have an increased number of them. Because of this, elephant cells require more
mutations than mice cells to develop a tumor. They are not immune but more resilient. This adaption probably comes with a cost in
some form but researchers still aren't sure what it is. Maybe tumor suppressors make elephants age quicker later in life or slow down how quickly injuries heal. We don't know yet. But the solution to the paradox
may actually be something different. ""Hypertumors"" Solution 2:  Hypertumors Solution 2: Hypertumors
(Yes) Solution 2: Hypertumors
(Yes, really.) Hypertumors are named after
hyperparasites: the parasites of parasites. Hypertumors are the tumors of tumors. Cancer can be thought of as
a breakdown in cooperation. Normally, cells work together to form structures like organs, tissue or elements of the immune system. But cancer cells are selfish and only work for their own short-term benefit. If they're successful, they form tumors;
huge cancer collectives that can be very hard to kill. Making a tumor is hard work though. Millions or billions of cancer cells multiply rapidly,
which requires a lot of resources and energy. The amount of nutrients they can steal from
the body becomes the limiting factor for growth. So the tumor cells trick the body to build new blood vessels directly to the tumor, to feed the thing killing it. And here, the nature of cancer cells
may become their own undoing. Cancer cells are inherently unstable
and so they can continue to mutate. Some of them faster than their buddies. If they do this for a while, at some point one of the copies of
the copies of the original cancer cell, might suddenly think of itself as an
individual again and stop cooperating. Which means just like the body, the original tumor suddenly becomes an enemy, fighting for the same scarce nutrients and resources. So the newly mutated cells can create a hypertumor. Instead of helping, they cut off the
blood supply to their former buddies, which will starve and kill the original cancer cells. Cancer is killing cancer. This process can repeat over and over, and this may prevent cancer from
becoming a problem for a large organism. It is possible that large animals have
more of these hyper tumors than we realize, they might just not become big enough to notice Which makes sense a two gram tumor
is 10% of a mouse's body weight, while It's less than 0.002% of a human and 0.000002% of a blue whale. All three tumors require the same number of
cell divisions and have the same number of cells. So an old blue whale might be filled
with tiny cancers and just not care. There are other proposed solutions to Peto's paradox, such as different metabolic rates or different cellular architecture. But right now we just don't know. Scientists are working on the problem. Figuring out how large animals are so resilient
to one of the most deadly diseases we know, could open the path to new therapies and treatments. Cancer has always been a challenge. Today, we are finally beginning to understand it and by doing so, one day we might finally overcome it."
uFk0mgljtns,2020-02-16T13:29:44.000000,How to Make a Kurzgesagt Video in 1200 Hours,"For years, people have asked how we make our videos. So. let's finally talk about it. How to Make a Kurzgesagt Video in 1,200 Hours or More (Kurzgesagt intro) Kurzgesagt in a Nutshell But first things first, we need a topic. Our potential topic list is already endless, and every time we research something, it grows longer. So, we just work on whatever we find exciting at the time. This could be something serious, fascinating, personal, or just really stupid. The variety is half the fun. We want to explain complicated things in an easily graspable way and make science-y topics fascinating and beautiful. But we also want to tell stories and express how we feel about the universe from time to time. Laying the Foundation: Script Our research begins by reading books or scientific papers and by talking to different experts who point us in the right direction. We want to have a fact-based worldview and our videos are trying to reflect that. So we often have to change our view on an issue while working on it. Usually after a few weeks of researching we start writing. A script begins with a rough first draft that's then rewritten and edited over and over again. To make sure we don't misrepresent something, We asked experts to fact-check and correct us. Writing is the bottleneck for our videos, and very hard to speed up. Usually, finishing a script takes between a few weeks and literally years to complete. Let's Visualize: Illustration When the script is ready, we begin sketching out the video. We try to think of visual metaphors, transitions between ideas, and decide which scenes need the most attention. On average, 200 panels need to be illustrated in Adobe Illustrator. Although we have built up an illustration library, We still do most illustrations from scratch to give our videos a more unique look. The general idea is to find the right images to the words in the script to explain as clearly as possible, while also having interesting things to look at. Also, here we include all the visual easter eggs. In total, two to three illustrators spend 8 to 12 weeks illustrating the video. Now It's My Turn: Narration When the whole video is illustrated, the narration is recorded in a small recording studio on a Neumann TLM 103 microphone and Pro Tools It's important to keep the flow, so I try to get one version done and then go back through, retaking paragraphs and sentences Until they feel right and a full version is ready. It's Alive: Animation Now the scenes and audio need to be animated. We make things move in Adobe After Effects and recently, we've begun experimenting with Cinema 4D. The first thing to do is take the illustrated scenes apart and organize them. The hundreds or thousands of parts are then imported into After Effects. Each character is rigged, so we can move them more naturally. Aside from a few plugins that help us save time, every single thing that's moving on-screen has been moved manually. So, two to three animators animate scene after scene for about eight to ten weeks in total. Ending On a High Note: Music and Sound Design The final step is the music. Every song is original music composed to the finished video to create a unique atmosphere and to highlight the important parts. You can listen to all of the songs on SoundCloud and Spotify. The icing on the cake are the sound effects. Many of you might not even really notice them, which is a shame because they really add an additional layer. So, try watching a video with headphones if you want to get the full depth of it. All of these steps happen in parallel, since we usually work on two to four videos at the same time in various stages. What we haven't mentioned are the countless revisions and edits. Every few days, we sit together and review our work and tweak it until it feels just right. And that's it - at least 1,200 hours for a single Kurzgesagt video. As you can imagine, making videos for thousands of hours as a big team and then putting them on the internet for free is a weird business model. Over the years, we've relied on a number of different things to stay afloat. Commercial work for NGOs, startups, or corporations Sponsorships and grants by companies or organizations. We struck a deal with Funk from German public broadcasting to revive the German channel and with Wix to start a Spanish channel. But the reality is, we can only do what we do because of you. Our two most important sources of income by far come from your direct support, merchandise and Patreon. So, if you want to help us stay afloat and keep making more videos, You can directly support Kurzgesagt by getting something beautiful from our store, or by becoming a patreon and joining the bird army. Don't feel obligated though. Watching, engaging, or sharing our videos is already helping us a lot. But if you want to support us directly, thank you so much. You're making our videos free for everyone. You are enabling us to practice and improve, to stay independent and to work on ambitious projects that would be too scary or too big otherwise. Kurzgesagt did not start with an end goal in mind. It began as a personal project because it felt good to make something with time and love, and this is still true today. Making these videos is our goal. Doing the work every day and getting better. To make science beautiful and interesting. Thank you so much for sticking with us for seven years and from our first subscriber to the ten millionth. This journey has been so wild and so much fun, and we can't wait to share the stuff We're working on right now with you; in a year, or maybe two. We want to make matter videos like this from time to time now. If you want to ask us questions that you want us to answer, you can do so on Reddit. Link in the description.

oakWgLqCwUc,2020-01-26T13:30:02.000000,Milk. White Poison or Healthy Drink?,"Over the last decade, milk has become a bit controversial. Some people say it's a necessary and nutritious food, vital for healthy bones, but others say it can cause cancer and lead to an early death. So, who's right? And why are we drinking it anyway? [Intro music] Milk is the basis of every mammal's diet after birth, when our digestive systems are immature and small. Basically, it's power food to kick-start our bodies and help us grow. Milk is rich in fat, vitamins, minerals, and milk-sugar: lactose. On top of that, for a while after birth, it also contains antibodies and proteins that protect us from infections and regulate our immune system. But it's a lot of effort for mothers to produce. Eventually, humans stop drinking mother's milk and transition to the diet of their parents. This is how it's been for thousands of years. Until about eleven thousand years ago, when our ancestors settled down in the first agricultural communities. Soon, they domesticated the first dairy animals: goats, sheep, and cattle. They found that dairy animals are able to eat useless and abundant stuff and turn it into nutritious and tasty food. This made a huge difference in terms of survival, especially in hard times. So groups that had milk available had an evolutionary advantage. And through natural selection, it changed the genes of communities who consumed a lot of it. This adaptation has to do with a specialized enzyme: lactase. Babies have a lot of it in their system, so they can break down the milk-sugar lactose and digest milk easily. But the older we grow, the fewer lactase enzymes our body produces. Worldwide, about 65% of the population do not have the enzyme after infancy, which means they are not able to digest more than about 150 milliliters each day. This lactose intolerance is not spread evenly around the world, though. In some East Asian communities, for example, it's up to 90%. In Northern Europe and North America, the rates are the lowest overall. There are probably a few reasons for this uneven distribution. The trait was first introduced by random mutation, which happened independently of each other in a few populations. The fact that farming replaced hunting and gathering more and more created natural-selection pressure. People who were able to digest lactose had more foods at hand, which was an advantage. The migration of dairy farmers to the north then spread it further, which probably pushed back populations there that didn't have the trait. Okay, but if milk has been a valuable part of our diet for thousands of years, why is it so controversial? There are a number of claims regarding the negative and positive health effects of milk. The negative ones cover a wide variety, from brittle bones to cancer, and cardiovascular diseases to intolerance and allergies. So, how do they hold up? Some older studies found a connection between milk and a high risk of breast, colon, and prostate cancer But meta analyses found no impact on your cancer risk. On the contrary, the calcium in milk might even have a protective effect against colon cancer. Although this could be calcium in general, it's not clear milk plays a role in this effect. Only studies on prostate cancer showed an increased risk for people who consumed more than one and a quarter liters of milk a day. But again, the association is inconsistent and other studies don't find any effects. We discuss these studies in more detail in our sources document. All in all, the research seems to show that if you drink between 100 to 250 milliliters of milk per day, cancer is not a concern. Similarly, meta-analyses could not find any impact from milk or dairy products on your risk of heart disease, stroke, or your total mortality. Some studies even suggested that high blood pressure might be rarer in people who eat a lot of dairy, although the evidence is not strong enough to claim this with confidence. The case gets more complicated though when we look at bones. A number of studies found neither positive nor negative effects for adults. What most people worry most about though are harmful amounts of pesticides, antibiotics, or hormones. There are hormones in milk, but only in very low concentrations. For example to get the same amount of hormones as from the pill, you'd need to drink about 5000 litres of milk, and even if you did, most hormones would be destroyed by your digestive system before they could affect you, which is the reason why so much medication is coated to protect it from our digestion. For pesticides and antibiotics, there are regulations in most parts of the world that only allow completely harmless amounts. Milk that surpasses these thresholds is not allowed to go on the shelf. So there's nothing in particular to worry about. Besides allergies and those suffering from lactose intolerances, the best known negative effects of milk are probably acne and general discomfort after drinking milk or eating dairy products, and here the effects are very real. For example, skimmed milk has been found to statistically increase the rate of acne by 24%. Allergies against milk products are especially prevalent among children, with one in 18 kids in Germany suffering from them. In general, these allergies tend to get better or disappear as they grow older though. Okay. Is milk healthy then? Milk, no matter if it comes from mothers, cows, sheep, goats, or camels is a nutrient-dense food. It contains all necessary macronutrients and many micronutrients. Especially in regions where people struggle to get enough calories, milk can contribute to a healthy life and lower child mortality. For those living in the developed world, in general milk is not harmful if you are not allergic or intolerant to it. Especially for children, it's a good way to get large amounts of calcium and for vegetarians, it's a good source of vitamin b12 and B vitamins in general. This does not mean there are not other alternatives with the same effect. You do not need to drink milk to be healthy Milk is also definitely not a substitute for water. Milk is power food, and the additional calories from drinking a lot of it on a regular basis can contribute to being overweight. Especially flavored milk or chocolate milk is more comparable to beverages like lemonade than a healthy snack, and there's another thing to consider. Milk production has a significant impact on the global climate. About 33 percent of cropland is used to feed grazing animals including dairy cattle Even though the carbon footprint of dairy products has declined since 1990, Dairy production is still responsible for 3 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, even more than all airplanes combined. Milk is a huge industry and sadly, most of its production in factory farms causes incredible suffering. Cows are impregnated over and over, separated from their young shortly after birth, and slaughtered once their tortured bodies are not productive anymore. We can't ignore that much of the milk we consume stems from an industry that is basically torture and contributes to climate change. What about plant-based milk? In terms of protein levels and nutritional value, only soy milk can compare to cow milk. The others need to be artificially enriched to reach similar levels of vitamins and calcium. So they can be an alternative to milk. And another option might be available soon. Several startups have created non-animal milk that is nutritionally identical to dairy milk, for example, through fermentation by gene modified bacteria. This lab-grown milk can even be turned into cheese, something that plant based alternatives struggle with because they lack casein and whey protein, the key ingredients that give dairy its taste and structure. The environmental impact is a different story though. Many milk alternatives use significantly less energy, land and less water to produce so they have a much lower environmental impact than animal milk. If you want to have the lowest possible negative impact on the planet, the best choice is whatever milk alternative is regional. As with almost any topic milk is complicated. It's not harmful for the majority of the population and it's crucial for many people around the world. It's good, nutritious food, but also harmful to the planet and causes a lot of suffering. We need to decide as a society how we want to deal with these facts."
v3y8AIEX_dU,2019-12-22T13:30:06.000000,How to Move the Sun: Stellar Engines,"Nothing in the universe is static. In the Milky Way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center. Some, like our Sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years. This dance is not an orderly ballet, more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighborhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second. Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point, we could encounter a star going supernova or a massive object passing by and showering Earth with asteroids. If something like this were to happen, we would likely know thousands if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn't do much about it. Unless, we move our whole solar system out of the way. [Snazzy Kurzgesagt intro music] To move the solar system, we need a stellar engine, a megastructure used to steer a star through the galaxy. It's the kind of thing that might be built by an advanced civilization with Dyson sphere-level technology that's thinking about their future millions of years ahead of time. But how do we possibly move the hundreds of thousands of objects in the solar system? The good news is we can ignore all of that. We only need to move the Sun; all the other stuff is glued to it by gravity and will follow it wherever it decides to go. There are lots of ideas about what a stellar engine might look like and how it would work. We've picked two, grounded in our current understanding of physics, that could be built in theory. The simplest kind of stellar engine is the Shkadov thruster, a giant mirror. It works on the same principle as a rocket. Like rocket fuel, the photons released as solar radiation carry momentum, not a lot but a bit. For example, if an astronaut turned on a flashlight in space, it would push them backwards very very slowly. A stellar engine will work a little better than a flashlight because the Sun produces a lot of photons. The basic idea of the Shkadov thruster is to reflect up to half of the solar radiation to create thrust, and slowly push the Sun where we want it to go. In order for the Shkadov thruster to work, it must be kept in the same place, not orbiting the Sun. Although the Sun's gravity will try to pull it in, it would be supported by radiation pressure which props the mirror up. This means the mirror would have to be very light, made of micron thin reflecting foil from materials like aluminium alloys. The mirror's shape is important too, enveloping the Sun in a giant spherical shell wouldn't work because that would refocus light back to the Sun, heating it up and creating all sorts of unpleasant problems. Instead we use a parabola, which sends most of the photons around the Sun and in the same direction, which maximizes thrust. To prevent accidentally burning or freezing Earth with too much or too little sunlight, the only safe place to build a Shkadov thruster is over the Sun's poles. This means we can only move the Sun vertically in the plane of the solar system and one direction in the Milky Way, which limits our travel options abate. But that is basically it. For a civilization capable of building a Dyson Sphere, this is a relatively simple endeavor. Not complicated, just very hard to build. At full throttle, the solar system could probably be moved by about a hundred light years over 230 million years. Over a few billion years, it gives us near complete control over the sun's orbit in the galaxy. But in the short term, this might not be fast enough to dodge a deadly supernova. That's why we thought we could do better. So we asked our astrophysicist friend if he could design a faster stellar engine for this video. He did and wrote a paper about it that's been published in a peer-reviewed journal. You can find it in our sources document. We're going to call at our new stellar engine the Caplan thruster. It works a lot like a traditional rocket: shoot exhaust one way to push yourself the other. It's a large space station platform powered by a Dyson sphere that gathers matter from the Sun to power nuclear fusion. It shoots out a very fast jet of particles at nearly 1 percent the speed of light out of the solar system. A second jet pushes the Sun along like a tugboat. The Caplan thruster requires a lot of fuel, millions of tons per second. To gather this fuel, our thruster uses very large electromagnetic fields to funnel hydrogen and helium from the solar wind into the engine. The solar wind alone doesn't provide enough fuel though, and that's where the Dyson sphere comes in. Using its power, sunlight can be refocused to the surface of the Sun. This heats small regions to extreme temperatures, lifting billions of tons of mass off the Sun. This mass can be collected and separated into hydrogen and helium. The helium is burned explosively in thermonuclear fusion reactors. A jet of Radioactive oxygen at a temperature of nearly a billion degrees is expelled and becomes our primary source of propulsion from our stellar engine. To prevent the engine from just crashing into the Sun, it needs to balance itself. To do this, We accelerate the collected hydrogen with electromagnetic fields using particle accelerators and shoot a jet back at the Sun. This balances the thruster and transfers the thrust of our engine back to the Sun. In as little as a million years, this engine can move the Sun by 50 light years, more than enough to dodge a supernova. At full throttle, the solar system can be completely redirected in its galactic orbit in 10 million years. But wait, will we use up the Sun this way? Fortunately the Sun is so massive that even billions of tons of material will barely scratch the surface. In fact, this megastructure will actually extend our Sun's life, since lower mass stars burn slower, keeping the solar system inhabitable for many more billions of years. With a Caplan thruster, we could turn the entire solar system into our spaceship. For example, by orbiting backwards in the galaxy and colonizing hundreds or thousands of stars as we pass by them. It may even be possible to escape the galaxy entirely and expand beyond the Milky Way. Stellar engines are the kind of machines built by civilizations thinking not in terms of years or decades but eons. Since we know that our Sun will die one day, a stellar engine could allow the far future descendants of humans to travel to other stars without ever having to venture into the terrifying dark abyss of interstellar space. Until we build a stellar engine, we're adrift and subject to the whims of the Galactic sea. We may not like where it leads us. Maybe our descendants will set sail and become an interstellar species for millions of years to come. This was our last video for the year 12,019 of the human era, and what a year it was. So much stuff happened everywhere, to so many different people. Calendars and holidays are just imaginary, but they help us to cut our lives into pieces that our brains can handle. We're leaving 12,019 behind with a weird mixture of disillusion and hope. The world is screwed up, But we can fix it. In a few days, this year will be over, and we'll get to try again. Thank you for watching our videos, and for sticking around for so many years. See you all in 12,020."
NMo3nZHVrZ4,2019-12-15T13:30:10.000000,Overpopulation & Africa,"For most of our history, the human population grew slowly, until new discoveries brought us more food, and made us live longer. In just a hundred years, the human population quadrupled. This led to apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth. But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s. Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop. The world population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century. But the big picture conceals the details. Let's look at one region in particular. Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2019, it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries. Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades, it's still much higher than in the rest of the world. While some projections expect around 2.6 billion people, others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100. Such growth would be a huge challenge for any society. But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth. So, is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed? And, why did the projections vary by 2.4 billion people? As always, it's complicated. Sub-Saharan Africa is a made-up idea, and in many ways, unhelpful one. Botswana is as far away from Sierra Leone, as Ireland is from Kazakhstan. And they have about as much in common. But without generalizing a little bit, this video would be an hour long! We've also talked to many different scientists for this video, and they disagreed on a lot of things. Mainly, on how much fertility matters to poverty. We've done our best to summarize our research and what they told us, but take it with a grain of salt, and check out our sources when we discussed this in more detail. Okay, let's zoom out to the global perspective again. A few decades ago, many countries in Asia were at a similar point to Sub-Saharan Africa today. Large parts of the population were living in extreme poverty, and birth rates were very high. Take Bangladesh. In the 1960s, the average woman had 7 children in her lifetime. 25% of them died before they turned 5, and of the ones that survived, only one of five would learn to read and write. Life expectancy was about 45, and per capita income was among the lowest in the world. So, beginning in the 1960s, Bangladesh started a family planning program, based on three main pillars. 1. Education helped to change women's outlook. Women with a higher education tend to want fewer kids, and become mothers later in life. 2. Better health care lowered child mortality, leading to parents' wanting fewer children, because they could expect them to survive. 3. Field workers brought contraceptives even to the remotest areas, which drove contraceptive use from 8% in 1975, to 76% in 2019. Together, these measures greatly slowed down population growth. In 1960, the average Bangladeshi women had 7 kids. In 1995, 4, and, in 2019, it was down to 2. This also changed the country's demographics and the economy. Before, many children were born, but died before they got to contribute to society. As far fewer kids die and fewer kids are born, things change. Kids get an education, and turn into productive adults. The government was able to shift some of their resources from lowering child mortality to boosting the economy. By 2024, Bangladesh is expected to graduate from the category of least developed countries to the status of a developing economy. Other Asian countries like South Korea, India, Thailand or the Philippines have gone through a similar process, often even faster. Investment in health and education led to lower birth rates, which changed the composition of the population, and enabled governments to boost the economy. Why didn't the same thing happen everywhere in Sub-Saharan Africa? Africa, as a whole, has made considerable progress with childhood mortality. but especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, education has improved slower than in other parts of the world. And, while in total, contraceptive use has doubled in the region since 1990, the unmet need for modern contraception among adolescents is still at about 60%. The reasons for this are complicated, and it's impossible to give a single answer here. Africa is a big place with diverse cultures and people. But there are a few main factors. Many Sub-Saharan Nations have suffered under colonization until only a few decades ago, and had rough transition periods towards independence. The young nations were often ethnically heterogeneous and lacked unity. Some areas have been repeatedly racked by civil wars, military conflicts or suffered under unstable governments, which made it really hard to expand infrastructure and health care. So, Africa had a worse starting point than Asia. Foreign aid and how it was applied, especially during the cold war, is also a contentious issue. But this topic is too complex to summarize in a few sentences, so we'll make a whole new video about it in the future. And lastly, there are cultural aspects that make talking about family plan in the context of Africa difficult. Critics say that trying to bring fertility down is an intrusion into culture and tradition. But not speaking about an issue will not help solve it. Not all of these things apply to every country in the region. We're talking about 46 countries after all, some of them deeply troubled, others already flourishing, all different and facing unique problems. If population growth continues at its present rate, then Sub-Saharan Africa could grow to more than 4 billion people by 2100. Okay. So, what can be done? Actually, a lot! Especially, investment and aid that helped to build systems for education, family planning, and health care. Surprisingly small changes could have an extreme impact. For example, if women get a better education, and have their first child just two years later in life. This tiny gap between this generation and the next one would lead to 400 million fewer people in 2100, with 3.6 billion in total. If education and family planning are made available to every African women, universal access to contraception makes having kids a decision. If families get to choose how many kids they want, birth projections fall by 30%, to 2.8. billion people. This isn't just theory. There are already examples that are reason for optimism. Ethiopia, the African country with the second-biggest population, has made a lot of progress in a relatively short amount of time. Improving health services lead to a drop in child mortality from 20% to 7% since 1990. And up to 30% of the annual budget was invested in education, and the number of schools increased 25-fold over two decades. So, summarizing, there are serious challenges ahead, but they are far from unsolvable. Sub-Saharan Africa does not need pity or gifts, but attention and fair investment. It's a region rich in resources, culture, and potential. If things go right, we'll see a turn-around similar to the one we've seen across most of Asia in the last 30 years. (quack)"
WPPPFqsECz0,2019-12-08T13:30:01.000000,An Antidote to Dissatisfaction,"Everybody is familiar with the feeling that things are not as they should be. That you're not successful enough, your relationship's not satisfying enough, that you don't have the things you crave. A chronic dissatisfaction that makes you look outwards with envy and inwards with disappointment. Pop culture, advertising, and social media make this worse by reminding you that aiming for anything less than your dream job is failure, you need to have great experiences constantly, be conventionally attractive, have a lot of friends, and find your soulmate, and that others have all of these things and are truly happy. And, of course, a vast array of self-improvement products implies that it's all your fault for not working hard enough on yourself. In the last two decades, researchers have been starting to investigate how we can counteract these impulses. The field of positive psychology emerged, the study of what makes life worth living, while cognitive behavioral therapy was developed to change negative feelings. Scientists began to ask ""Why are some people happier and more satisfied than others?"" ""And are there ways to apply what they're doing right to the rest of us?"" In this video, we want to talk about one of the strongest predictors of how happy people are, how easily they make friends, and how good they are at dealing with hardship. An antidote to dissatisfaction, so to speak: Gratitude. While gratitude may sound like another self-improvement trend, preached by people
who use hashtags, what we currently know about it is based
on a body of scientific work and studies. We'll include them in the description. Gratitude can mean very different things
to different people in different contexts. It's a character trait, a feeling,
a virtue, and a behavior. You can feel grateful towards someone
who did something for you, for random events,
like the weather, or even for nature or fate, and it's wired into our biology. 1: How Gratitude Connects Us to Each Other. The predecessor of gratitude
is probably reciprocity. It likely evolved as
a biological signal that motivates animals to exchange
things for their mutual benefit and can be found
in the animal kingdom among certain fish,
birds, or mammals, but especially in primates. When your brain recognizes that
someone's done something nice for you, it reacts with gratitude to
motivate you to repay them. This gratitude makes
you care about others, and others care about you. This was important because, as human brains got
better at reading emotions, selfish individuals were
identified and shunned. It became an evolutionary advantage
to play well with others and build lasting relationships. For example,
if you were hungry and someone else showed
you where to find tasty berries, you felt gratitude towards them and a bond to return
the favor in the future, a drive to be pro-social. When you repaid them,
they felt gratitude towards you. This brought your ancestors
closer together and forged bonds and friendships. So, early forms of gratitude
were biological mechanisms that modified your behavior
towards cooperation, which helped humans
to dominate Earth. But, over time, gratitude became more than
just an impulse to play fair. 2: The Consequences of Gratitude Scientists found that gratitude
stimulates the pathways in your brain involved in feelings of reward, forming social bonds, and interpreting other's intentions. It also makes it easier to save
and retrieve positive memories Even more, gratitude directly counteracts
negative feelings and traits, like envy and social comparison, narcissism, cynicism, and materialism. As a consequence, people who
are grateful, no matter what for, tend to be happier and more satisfied. They have better relationships, an easier time making friends. They sleep better, tend to suffer less from
depression, addiction, and burnout, and are better at dealing
with traumatic events. In a way, gratitude makes it
less likely that you'll fall into one of the psychological traps
modern life has set for you. For example, gratitude
measurably counters the tendency to forget and
downplay positive events. If you work long and
hard for something, actually getting it can feel
daft and empty. You can find yourself emotionally
back where you started and try to achieve
the next biggest thing, looking for that satisfaction, instead of being satisfied with yourself. Or, imagine being lonely and
wanting to have more friends. You actually might have someone or even multiple people
who want to hang out, but you might feel that
this is not enough, that you're a loser and
feel bad about yourself. So you might turn down
their attempts to hang out and become more lonely. If you feel grateful for
your relationships instead, you might accept invitations or even take the initiative. The more often you risk opening up, the higher the chance of
solidifying relationships and meeting new people. In the best case, gratitude
can trigger a feedback loop. Positive feelings lead to
more pro-social behavior, which leads to more
positive social experiences that cause more
positive feelings. This is a common experience
after serious hardship, like chemotherapy, for example. Life can feel amazing
after a crisis is over. The smallest things can be
bottomless sources of joy, from being able to taste to just sitting in the sun
or chatting with a friend. Objectively, your life is the same or
maybe even slightly worse than before, but your brain compares
your present experiences with the times
when life was bad and reacts with gratitude. So, in a nutshell, gratitude refocuses your attention
towards the good things you have, and the consequences of this shift are better feelings and
more positive experiences. While it is great to
know these things, is there actually a way for
you to feel more of it? 3: How To Make Your Brain More Grateful The ability to experience
more or less gratitude is not equally distributed. You have what's known as
trait gratitude, that determines how much
you are able to feel it. It depends on your genetics,
personality, and culture. This discovery made
scientists wonder if they could design exercises
that change your trait gratitude and lead to more happiness. Let's start with
important caveats. It's not yet entirely clear to what degree
gratitude can be trained or how long the effects last. There are no
magic pills for happiness. Life is complicated. On some days, it feels like
you're in control of yourself, and, on others, you
feel like you're not. And this is okay. Also, sometimes pursuing happiness
can make you more unhappy if you put too much pressure on yourself. Gratitude should also not be seen
as a solution to depression or a substitute for professional help,. It can only be a piece of the puzzle. It's not the solution to the puzzle itself. The easiest gratitude exercise,
with the most solid research behind it, is gratitude journaling. It means sitting down
for a few minutes, one to three times a week, and writing down five to ten
things you're grateful for It might feel weird at first, so start simply. Can you feel grateful
for a little thing? Like how great coffee is, or that someone
was kind to you. Can you appreciate something
someone else did for you? Can you reflect on which things or people
you would miss if they were gone and be grateful that they're in your life? We're all different, so you'll know what
works for you. And that's it, really. It feels almost insulting, like things shouldn't
be that simple. But in numerous studies, the participants reported
more happiness and a higher general
life satisfaction after doing this practice
for a few weeks. And, even more, studies have found 
changes in brain activity some months
after they ended. Practicing gratitude may be
a real way to reprogram yourself. This research shows that
your emotions are not fixed. In the end, how
you experience life is a representation of
what you believe about it. If you attack your core beliefs
about yourself and your life, you can change your
thoughts and feelings, which automatically
changes your behavior. It's pretty mind-blowing that
something as simple as self-reflection can hack the pathways in our brain
to fight dissatisfaction. And, if this is no reason
to be more optimistic, what is? Being a human is hard, but it doesn't need
to be as hard. And, if you actively look, you might find that your life is
much better than you thought. [Happy bark] [Party horn] If you're curious and
want to try out gratitude, we made a thing. Please note that you don't need to buy
anything from anyone to practice gratitude. All you need is paper,
a pen, and five minutes. Having said that, we've made
a Kurzgesagt gratitude journal, based on studies we've read, conversations with experts, and our personal experiences
with gratitude over the last year. It's structured in a way that
might make it a bit easier to get into the habit of
gratitude journaling. There are short explanations
and reflections to mix it up and make it more interesting. We've also made it
as pretty as we could. This video continues
the unofficial series of more personal,
introspective videos, from optimistic nihilism to
loneliness and now gratitude. We don't want to be
a self-help channel, so we'll keep this sort of video
at roughly one per year. We hope they're helpful
to some of you. Thank you for watching. [Outro theme] [Quack]

dqwpQarrDwk,2019-11-17T13:30:03.000000,"1,000km Cable to the Stars - The Skyhook","Getting to space is hard. Right now, it’s like going up on a mountain on a unicycle- with a backpack full of explosives. Incredibly slow, you can’t transport a lot of stuff, and you might die. A rocket needs to reach a velocity about 40,000km an hour to escape from Earth. To get to that speed, rockets are mostly containers for fuel with a tiny tip of payload. This is bad if you want to go to other planets, because you need a lot of heavy stuff if you want to survive, and maybe even come back. So, is there a way to get to space with less fuel and more payload? A nice thing that solved most of our transport problems on Earth is what you call infrastructure. Whether it’s roads for cars, ports for ships, or rails for trains, we’ve made it easier to get to places. We can apply the same solution to space travel. Space infrastructure will make getting into orbit and out to the Moon, Mars, and beyond easier and cheaper. Great, but what exactly is space infrastructure? Unlike an Earth space elevator, which is currently science fiction, there is a simple yet promising technology that does not require new science, magic materials, or huge investments, and that has been tested successfully in orbit already. A cable and a weight, known as a tether. The concept is so simple; it’s surprising. What if we put tethers, hundreds or thousands of kilometers long — into space, and had spacecraft use them as ladders to climb to higher altitudes and gain speed? This concept is known as the Skyhook. It works even better if we make it spin. A counterweight holds a long cable in place while it rotates around a circle. A rotating tether slows down its tip relative to the ground at the bottom and speeds it up at the top like a catapult. This means that you can transfer energy from the tether and get a massive boost when released, more-or-less for free, equal to twice the tether’s rotation velocity. Specialized fibers already exist that can survive the extraordinary stresses a Skyhook would be faced with. To protect against cuts and collisions from debris and meteorites, we can thread our tether into a web of redundant fibres. Since our Skyhook would pass over the same spot many times a day, this would allow small, reusable shuttles to catch up with it. Of course, it’s not that easy. At its lowest point, the tether’s tip is dashing through the atmosphere at around 12,000km/h. Because of Earth's atmosphere, we can’t lower the Skyhook too much or it will get too hot from air friction. So it will dip to a height of 80 to 150 kilometers and no lower. To match this, we’ll need specialized spacecraft that can get to the tether. While this isn't exactly easy, it’s still much cheaper than getting a big tin can, filled with rocket fuel, to go 40,000km/h. Catching the tip will be a challenge too. There’s only a short time window of 60 to 90 seconds to find a tiny thing in the sky, moving at Mach 12. To make this easier, the tip could have a sort of fishing line a kilometer long with a navigation drone that helps the spacecraft connect. Another challenge is keeping our Skyhook in orbit. As more and more ships latch onto it and pull themselves up, they use up the momentum that keeps it in place. If we don’t do anything, it will slow down and crash into the atmosphere. And here, we can cheat the universe a bit. The Skyhook is a battery of orbital energy. It’s possible to balance the payloads coming in and being sent off. Arriving ships bringing humans and materials home to earth add energy to the tether, which it can give to other ships departing into space. This way, the tether doesn’t lose any energy. The more we use it, the cheaper it gets. If we’re still losing energy with each boost, we can recover it with small electric or chemical engines that regularly correct the tether’s position. A set of tethers, one around earth and one around Mars, could make trips between the planets fast, straight-forward and low cost compared to rockets. The Earth tether would sit in low earth orbit to grab people and payloads and fling them off to Mars. The Mars tether catches them and slows them down for a landing on the surface. In the opposite direction, the tether could pick up a vehicle travelling through Mars’ thin atmosphere at only about 1,000km/h not much faster than our airliners on Earth, and fling it back to Earth to be caught and lowered down. The tethers could shorten trips between both planets, from nine months down to five or even three, and reduce the scale of the rockets required by between 84 and 96 percent. Even better: people may be able to travel in relative luxury as we could afford to invest in passenger comfort. Tether travel would be first-class seats to Mars! Together, tethers around Earth and Mars could provide the rapid and cost-efficient transportation backbone that would make space travel affordable. But let’s go further. Starting from low Mars orbit, a tether could boost ships to the asteroid belt. The first craft sent to a new asteroid would need rockets to slow down at its destination. Subsequent arrivals might find a tether waiting to catch them and send them back for free. Getting to asteroids cheaply is a major factor in opening up the resources of the solar system. Precious metals and valuable minerals could be delivered to Mars just weeks after they were cut out of their asteroid. They would be the perfect building blocks for our interplanetary civilization. But why stop here? Mars moons are very convenient. No other moons in the solar system orbit that close to their planet. Phobos is so heavy that we don’t need to worry about slowing it down, making it the perfect attachment point for super-tethers just under 6,000km long. The lower tip would fly just over the surface of Mars and be very easy to catch. The upper tip can fling ships all the way to Jupiter and Saturn. The same super-tether can also bring the inner solar system closer. Venus and Mercury are a single swing away. Unlike Mars, they’re bursting with solar energy and are rich in minerals. In the long term, nothing is stopping humanity from constructing a zero-propellent transport network for the terrestrial planets, centered on the Martian moons. Tethers are a comparably cheap and sustainable solution to making space travel affordable and the rest of the solar system accessible for exploitation and exploration. Considering that we have the technology to build them today, there’s really no good excuse to wait any longer. Parts of the solar system are far away, but they could be very close."
udFxKZRyQt4,2019-11-10T13:30:02.000000,Neutron Stars – The Most Extreme Things that are not Black Holes,"Neutron stars are one of the most extreme and violent things in the universe. Giant atomic nuclei, only a few kilometers in diameter, but as massive as stars. And they owe their existence to the death of something majestic. [Intro music] Stars exist because of a fragile balance. The mass of millions of billions of trillions of tons of hot plasma are being pulled inwards by gravity, and squeeze material together with so much force that nuclei fuse Hydrogen fuses into helium. This releases energy which pushes against gravity and tries to escape. As long as this balance exists, stars are pretty stable. Eventually, the hydrogen will be exhausted. Medium stars, like our Sun, go through a giant phase, where they burn helium into carbon and oxygen before they eventually turn into white dwarfs. But in stars many times the mass of our Sun, things get interesting when the helium is exhausted. For a moment, the balance of pressure and radiation tips, and gravity wins, squeezing the star tighter than before. The core burns hotter and faster, while the outer layers of the star swell by hundreds of times, fusing heavier and heavier elements. Carbon burns to neon in centuries, neon to oxygen in a year, oxygen to silicon in months, and silicon to iron in a day. And then… …death. Iron is nuclear ash. It has no energy to give and cannot be fused. The fusion suddenly stops, and the balance ends. Without the outward pressure from fusion, the core is crushed by the enormous weight of the star above it. What happens now is awesome and scary. Particles, like electrons and protons, really don’t want to be near each other. But the pressure of the collapsing star is so great that electrons and protons fuse into neutrons, which then get squeezed together as tightly as in atomic nuclei. An iron ball, the size of the Earth, is squeezed into a ball of pure nuclear matter, the size of a city. But not just the core; The whole star implodes, gravity pulling the outer layers in at 25% the speed of light. This implosion bounces off the iron core, producing a shock wave that explodes outwards and catapults the rest of the star into space. This is what we call a supernova explosion, and it will outshine entire galaxies. What remains of the star is now a neutron star. Its mass is around a million times the mass of the Earth but compressed to an object about 25 kilometers wide. It’s so dense that the mass of all living humans would fit into one cubic centimeter of neutron star matter. That’s roughly a billion tons in a space the size of a sugar cube. Put another way, that’s Mount Everest in a cup of coffee. From the outside, a neutron star is unbelievably extreme. Its gravity is the strongest, outside black holes, and, if it were any denser, it would become one. Light is bent around it, meaning you can see the front and parts of the back. Their surfaces reach 1,000,000 degrees Celsius, compared to a measly 6,000 degrees for our Sun. Okay, let’s look inside a neutron star. Although these giant atomic nuclei are stars, in many ways, they’re also like planets, with solid crusts over a liquid core. The crust is extremely hard. The outermost layers are made of iron left over from the supernova, squeezed together in a crystal lattice, with a sea of electrons flowing through them. Going deeper, gravity squeezes nuclei closer together. We find fewer and fewer protons, as most merge to neutrons. Until we reach the base of the crust. Here, nuclei are squeezed together so hard that they start to touch. Protons and neutrons rearrange, making long cylinders or sheets, enormous nuclei with millions of protons and neutrons shaped like spaghetti and lasagna, which physicists call nuclear pasta. Nuclear pasta is so dense that it may be the strongest material in the universe, basically unbreakable. Lumps of pasta inside a neutron star can even make mountains at most a few centimeters high, but many times as massive as the Himalayas. Eventually, beneath the pasta, we reach the core. We’re not really sure what the properties of matter are when they’re squeezed this hard. Protons and neutrons might dissolve into an ocean of quarks, a so-called quark-gluon plasma. Some of those quarks might turn into strange quarks, making a sort of strange matter, with properties so extreme, that we made a whole video about it. Or, maybe they just stay protons and neutrons. No one knows for sure, and that’s why we do science. That’s all pretty heavy stuff, literally, so let’s go back out into space. When neutron stars first collapse, they begin to spin very, very fast, like a ballerina pulling her arms in. Neutron stars are celestial ballerinas, spinning many times per second. This creates pulses because their magnetic field creates a beam of radio waves, which passes every time they spin. These radio pulsars are the best-known type of neutron star. About 2,000 are known of in the Milky Way. These magnetic fields are the strongest in the universe, a quadrillion times stronger than Earth’s after they’re born. They’re called magnetars until they calm down a little. But the absolute best kind of neutron stars are friends with other neutron stars. By radiating away energy as gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime, their orbits can decay, and they can crash into and kill each other in a kilonova explosion that spews out a lot of their guts. When they do, the conditions become so extreme that, for a moment, heavy nuclei are made again. It’s not fusion putting nuclei together this time, but heavy neutron-rich matter falling apart and reassembling. Only very recently, we’ve learned that this is probably the origin of most of the heavy elements in the universe, like gold, uranium, and platinum, and dozens more. So there now two neutron stars collapse and become a black hole, dying yet again. Not only do stars have to die to create elements, they have to die twice. Over millions of years, these atoms will mix back into the galaxy, but some of them end up in a cloud, which gravity pulls together to form stars and planets, repeating the cycle. Our solar system is one example, and the remains of those neutron stars that came before us are all around us. Our entire technological modern world was built out of the elements neutron stars made in eons past, sending these atoms on a thirteen-billion-year journey to come together and make us and our world. And that’s pretty cool."
5iPH-br_eJQ,2019-10-13T12:30:00.000000,What if We Nuke a City?,"Playing around with nuclear weapons in videos is fun. There's a visceral joy in blowing things up, and a horrifying fascination with things
like fireballs, shockwaves, and radiation. And while it does help put our destructive
power in perspective, it's not the best way of understanding 
the real impact of a nuclear explosion. This isn't about silly stacks of TNT, or about how bright an explosion is. Nuclear weapons are about you. So we've partnered with the Red Cross
and Red Crescent movement to explore what would really happen if a nuclear weapon were detonated in a major city today. Not nuclear war, just one explosion. *Kurzgesagt Intro Music* We begin our story in the middle of
downtown in a major city. People are going to work, studying for exams, are lost in their thoughts and daily lives. Right here a nuclear weapon is detonated
and time freezes. The first phase of the explosion happens
within less than a second. In a millisecond, a ball of plasma hotter than the Sun appears and grows in a fireball to more than 2 kilometres across. Within this ball, everyone is just gone. Think of water dripped on to a very hot pan. A sizzle, and then there's nothing. Most buildings, cars, trees, 
tacky sculptures and people... ... all evaporated. First, the flash: an intense tsunami of light washes over the city in an instant. If you happen to have your head pointed in the direction of the explosion, it renders you blind for a few hours. The heat of this light produces a thermal pulse, so energetic and hot that it just burns everything as far as 13 kilometres from the detonation site. What this means is that everything in an area of 500 square kilometres that is able to burn, starts burning. Plastic, wood, fabric, hair, and skin. If you happen to be in reach of the thermal pulse, one moment, you're on your way to work, the next moment, you're on fire. Now the second phase begins. It happens in a few seconds. Most people will now first notice
that something is wrong, but it's already too late for hundreds of thousands. The flash is followed by the shockwave. The heat and radiation of the fireball create a bubble of superheated and super-compressed air around it that's now expanding explosively. Faster than the speed of sound, creating winds stronger than hurricanes and tornadoes. Human infrastructure is no match for its power. Most major buildings within a kilometre of the fireball are just ground up down to their base. Only steel reinforced concrete is able to
partially resist the pressure. In the surrounding parks where retirees feed the ducks, trees blackened and smoldering from the heat a second before snap like toothpicks. If you're outside, you get tossed away 
like a grain of dust in a tornado. The shockwave weakens as it travels outwards but still, about 175 square kilometres of houses collapse like they're made of cards, trapping tens of thousands of people 
who didn't have any time to react. Gas stations explode and fire spread
throughout the rubble. A mushroom cloud made from the remains of the fireball, dust and ash rises kilometres into the sky in the next few minutes and casts a dark shadow over the ruined city. This violently pulls in fresh air surrounding the city, destroying more buildings and providing
an abundance of oxygen. It depends on the city what happens next. If there's enough fuel, fires may turn into a firestorm that burns the rubble, everybody trapped in it and people trying to flee the devastation. Up to 21 kilometres from the explosion, people just like you rush to their windows to take pictures of the mushroom cloud, unaware that the shockwave is still coming at them, about to shatter their windows and create
a blizzard of sharp glass. The third phase begins in the coming hours and days. We're used to the idea that help will come,
no matter the disaster. This time is different: a nuclear explosion is like every natural disaster at once. There are hundreds of thousands or millions of people with serious injuries: lacerations, broken bones, serious burns. In the next few minutes and hours, thousands more will die because of these injuries. Countless people are trapped in collapsed buildings like in earthquakes or blinded by the flash, deaf from the blast wave and unable to flee through streets impassable with rubble and debris. They're terrified, confused, and don't know what's happened to them or why. Most likely, many hospitals have been leveled along with all the other buildings and most medical professionals are either dead or injured, along with everyone else. The survivors lucky enough to have been in metro tunnels or standing in the right place to be unburned and unhurt won't have truly escaped harm yet. Depending on the type of weapon, where it explodes and even the weather, an awful black rain can begin, with radioactive ash and dust descending on the city, covering everything and everyone. The invisible, malicious, silent horror of
radiation takes its turn. Every breath carries poison to the lungs of the survivors. Over the coming days, the people who receive the highest doses of radiation exposure will die. There will be no help, not for hours or maybe even days. Civilisation doesn't operate when 
there is a total breakdown of infrastructure. Roads are blocked, train tracks warped, runways cluttered with rubble. No water, no electricity, no communication, no stores to replenish supplies from. Help from surrounding cities will have a hard time entering the disaster zone and even if they can, the radioactive contamination will make it risky to get too close. After a nuclear attack, you're on your own. So, bit by bit, people emerge from the rubble on foot, contaminated with radioactive fallout, carrying what little they may have left. They are slow, in pain, traumatized, and they all need food, water and medical treatment fast. And the damage done by a nuclear weapon doesn't end when the fires burn out and the smoke clears. The hospitals in the neighboring cities are under-equipped for a disaster of this scale and overwhelmed with tens or hundreds of thousands of patients with serious injuries. In the weeks, months and years to come, many of those who survived will succumb to cancers like leukemia. The reason no government wants you to think about all this is because there is no serious humanitarian response possible to a nuclear explosion. There's no way to really help the immediate victims of a nuclear attack. This is not a hurricane, wildfire or earthquake or nuclear accident. It is all of these things at once, but worse. No nation on earth is prepared to deal with it. The world has changed in the past few years, with world leaders again explicitly and publicly threatening each other with nuclear weapons. Many experts think the danger of a nuclear strike is higher than it has been in decades. Governments tell their citizens that it's good that we have nuclear weapons, but it's bad when anyone else gets them. That it's somehow necessary to threaten others with mass destruction to keep us safe. But does this make you feel safe? It only takes a small group of people with power to go crazy or rogue, a small misstep or a simple misunderstanding to unleash a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions. Exploding stuff in videos is fun. Exploding things in real life, not so much. There is a solution though! Eliminating all nuclear weapons 
and vowing never to build them again. In 2017, almost 2/3 of all the world's countries, supported by hundreds of civil society organizations and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement agreed to prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons. It's not about who has nuclear weapons and who doesn't. The weapons themselves are the problem. They are deeply immoral and an existential threat to all of us. No matter what country you come from, no matter what political side you find yourself on, we need to demand that they disappear forever. This will not happen without pressure. If you want to be part of this pressure, there are things you personally can do too: Visit notonukes.org to learn more about nuclear weapons and what you can do about them. *Kurzgesagt Outro Music*

cqECNYmM23A,2019-09-29T12:30:01.000000,The Billion Ant Mega Colony and the Biggest War on Earth,"In nearly every corner of the earth, ants wage war against each other. Their weapons are what nature gave them. Some have strong armor, deathly stingers, or sharp mandibles. And then there's this
tiny and not very impressive ant, but it rules the biggest empire any ant has ever built. A colony spanning continents and fighting wars that leave millions of casualties. Let's take a look at this unlikely warrioress, ""Linepithema humile""  
the Argentine ant. ♫ Kurzgesagt intro music ♫ This story begins in the floodplains 
around the Paraná River, in South America, It's a crowded ant megalopolis where dozens of ant species fight for dominance, including fire ants, army ants and the rather unimpressive Argentine ant. It measures only 2 to 3 millimeters in length and with its small mandibles, it's surprising that it survived among its buff competitors. Their homes are equally unremarkable. Their colonies range from fairly small to very large 
and could be found anywhere: Under logs, in loose leaf litter
or the former colonies of other ants. Here, Argentine ants prepare their most
effective weapon against their competitors: bodies. Most ant species have
only one queen to produce ants, while Argentine ants went all-in on numbers. For every 120 workers there's one queen, laying up to 60 eggs a day. So their colonies grow fast and have millions or billions of individuals. Teams of queens and workers frequently branch out and found new colonies. But this strategy has a downside: 
As colonies grow and produce a lot of offspring, mutations occur and new colonies adapt to new environments. Their DNA slowly changes from generation to generation and differences accumulate. So after a while the ants that left the colony will become more like distant cousins and start to compete with their mother colony. In their native South American range, this is how Argentine ants behave. Within their colonies they are very cooperative
and well-organized, but they fight vicious wars against other Argentine ant colonies and other ant species With equally strong opponents on every side, the Argentine ant became extremely
aggressive, fighting for every inch of ground. But it could never dominate its neighbours...
 until humans showed up. We did what humans do and transported things around the world by ship. On one of them, a few Argentine ant queens hitched a ride as stowaways from South America to Madeira and New Orleans. The Argentine ants suddenly found themselves in a strange world. Instead of being surrounded by deadly enemies, they found only victims ⁠— 
nobody could fight them effectively. Because only a few Argentine ant queens
were introduced to the outside world, the resulting colonies had very low genetic diversity. On top of that, the introduced Argentine ants kill up to 90% of their queens every year. Fewer queens, less genetic variation. So, as these colonies spread across the landscape, ants that left the colony were no longer
considered distant cousins. As a result, the new colonies form not opposing but cooperating parties called  ""supercolonies"". This is a very uncommon
strategy in the ant kingdom, only a few of the 16,000 ant species have evolved supercolonies. A supercolony was established on the
West coast of the USA and became a base for the tiny ants' global conquest. Today, the Argentine ant inhabits the Mediterranean zones of six continents and many islands. This one supercolony was especially successful, establishing sister locations in California, Europe, Japan, New Zealand and Australia, forming one massive intercontinental megacolony of Argentine ants. This makes them  the largest society on Earth,
more numerous than even the human one. But their success has changed the ecosystems they invaded. California is a perfect example of this. In their greed for more territory, the invading Argentine ants have overrun and replaced 90% of the native ant species, including several species of Californian carpenter ants. Although carpenter ant workers are giants, their colonies have only between 3,000 and 6,000 individuals and stand no chance against an expanding supercolony of billions of Argentine ants. Argentine ant workers attack by wiping toxic chemicals on their victims which irritates the enemy and marks them as a target for other Argentine ants. When they attack, the Argentine ants wash over their victims, clinging on to their opponents in groups 
and pulling apart their limbs. It doesn't matter how many of them die ⁠— 
there are always more. Once the colony is overrun and exterminated, the Argentine ants feed on their victims brood and take over their home and territory. The Argentine ants' numbers allow them to hunt down and devour such an excessive mass of different insects that over time some species disappear
from the ants' territory completely. Argentine ants don't care about working
with the local flora and fauna, they consume them and move on. And, if their next stop happens to be human property, they will rudely make themselves at home there too. They forage in dumpsters, bowls of pet food and sneak into kitchens to claim leftovers. Not just our homes: our gardens and
fields are also impacted by Argentine ants, since they tend to hordes of aphids as their cattle. The aphids feed from plants and produce a sweet honeydew, which they trade with the ants for protection. Since the ants have no major enemy to fear in their new homes, the aphids thrive  and ultimately kill the plants they live on. So, on top of being a major disruption
for the ecosystems they invade, they are also a huge pest for agriculture. But the rule of the Argentine ant is being challenged. Parts of the super colonies have broken off and become their own empires. A merciless civil war has broken out. For example, the Lake Hodges Supercolony has been fighting against the Very Large Colony for years in San Diego County. A massive war is going on over a dynamic front line stretching over kilometers, an estimated 30 million ants die here each
year. On other fronts, an old acquaintance from the Parana River has risen from the shadows Red imported fire ants, which were accidentally introduced from their
old home to the coast of Alabama, Not only are the red fire ants fierce fighters
and more than able to deal with the Argentine ant, they are also able to form
super colonies themselves. Now the old wars from their distant home have been
taken to a foreign battleground. In the southeastern US the super colonies
clashed fiercely. The Argentine ants found themselves outgunned by the fire ants. The fire ants major workers are more than twice the size of the
Argentine ants and wield venom-injecting stingers, even though the Argentine ants
fought fiercely, the fire ants were too much for them. After countless lost
battles the red imported fire ant exterminated the Argentine ants super
colony from much of the southeastern US. This is one territory lost but the
Argentine ants will fight on. This amazing network of cooperating super
colonies is the biggest success in their history. And they'll not give it up because of a small defeat. They will stand their
ground against any enemy that might arise. No matter if it's on the Paraná River or on one of the large battlefields across the world. ♫ Background music winds up ♫"

And of that small percentage, around 90% is located close to the surface in the first 200 meters. This is where we begin our journey. Here, light can still penetrate the water which allows photosynthesis to occur. Phytoplankton, trillions and trillions of single-celled algae and bacteria make up the foundation of the ocean's ecosystem, and they're consumed by bigger plankton, who are consumed by other species. The seafloor at this depth is akin to the Amazon rainforest, and is often covered with coral reefs, algae, and other sea plants that are home to a plethora of sea animals. So far, we've focused most of our attention on this comparatively pleasant environment, where we fish, swim, pollute, and do science. So, let's dive deeper. Moving from familiar coastal waters into deeper, more remote waters, we eventually reach the edge of the continental shelf, where we're confronted with the continental slope, the long descent down to the deep sea. With every additional metre of water, light fades drastically, which means there are basically no more plants, and the seemingly steep continental slope begins to remind us of the surface of the Moon. Looking out we're faced by what seems to be endless open water. Let's leave the slope behind us, and enter what's known as the twilight zone, the portal to the deep sea. As we sink down further, the water pressure rises to deadly levels. The deepest scuba dive ever came in at 332 meters. At that depth, the pressure is like having 200 cars stacked on top of you. Yet we've only completed 3% of our journey. While this region seems pretty grim, many fish and other animals actually spend at least half their lives down here. During the day, it's a good place to rest and recover, hidden from predators in the vast dark waters. At night, they can travel more safely into shallower zones to feed in the food-rich surface waters. In this transition zone between twilight and darkness, light becomes a powerful tool. Over 90% of the species indigenous to this deep environment use bioluminescence chemicals to create light. They do so as camouflage against the very faint sunlight, to send signals to potential mates, or to confuse and scare attackers. Or, they use lights to hunt. Another tool for survival in the dark is teamwork. At around 700 metres, we encounter a colony of siphonophores. They can be up to 50 metres in length, but are only as wide as a broomstick. To attract prey, a colony creates a tragically beautiful bright blue or red light, and deploys a curtain of tentacles filled with toxic needles that kill anything that comes too close. But most species living down here have to rely on an unlikely resource: marine snow. White flaky stuff that constantly sinks from the surface to the bottom of the ocean. It consists of dead plant or animal parts, fecal matter, shells, sand, or dust. Even though this doesn't sound very tasty, without this crucial resource, life in the deep sea would starve. It's in this area that the most fascinating battles between two unlikely enemies could happen. Sperm whales hunt and attack giant squid the size of a house. While the squid fight back ferociously, they probably don't stand a chance, but they do leave permanent marks on their killer's skin. As we reach 1,000 meters, deeper than the tallest structure built by humans, we need to be careful. This is the midnight zone, a place of utter darkness. A barely explored wet wasteland consisting of nothing but endless black open water. At these depths, it's harder for a human to take a swim than to take a walk in space. Finding food down here is really hard, so life had to adapt, and become extremely energy efficient. Like the 30-centimetre-long vampire squid that floats through the water without motion, with long and slender catching arms extended. They're covered in tiny stiff hairs, which brush food from the water. This saves a lot of energy compared to actively catching food. For carnivorous fish, it's much harder to find food since living prey is quite rare down here. So the hunters have to get a perfect grip on their victim on first strike, otherwise it will escape into the dark. Many deep-sea predators have several sets of long and deadly teeth. Like the viperfish, which uses its long fangs to trap even large prey and swallow it whole. Or the frilled shark, with its impressive set of 300 teeth, which are curved backwards to hook their victims in their mouths. We sink further, below the 3,800 mark, as deep as the grave of the Titanic. We are now at abyssal depths. Here, life happens in slow motion. Preserving every last bit of energy is crucial for survival. Everything down here hovers motionless, or swims in a slow, elegant fashion. The only time the animals living in this zone move fast is when they have to escape danger. Like the Dumbo octopod paddling with its ear-like fins, or the grenadiers fish with its slow, eel-like tail beats. At 4,000 meters, we finally reach ground again: the abyssal plain. It's covered in grey mud and rocks dusted with the remains of marine snow, which is consumed by animals like sea cucumbers, shrimp, sea urchins, and sea worms. In some regions of the seafloor, small, dark mineral deposits can be seen. These are manganese nodules. Deep-sea corals and sponges use them to anchor themselves on the bottom of the sea. Though life is sparse on the deep sea floor, even down here there are oases. In the rift valleys, where tectonic plates are splitting apart, magma heats up seawater and creates dark jets of water and minerals as hot as 400℃ that form elaborate chimneys and towers. Extremophile bacteria use the minerals to create organic substances that are the bases for unique ecosystems. As we descend further, we reach the deepest point of the abyssal plain at 6,000 meters. For most of the seafloor, this is as deep as it gets, but if we want to get to the deepest point of the oceans, we're actually only halfway there. Let's enter the hadal zone, the underworld of the sea. It consists of long narrow trenches that only make up around 0.25% of the oceans, and are among the most extreme environments on Earth. Only extremophiles exist down here, like the ethereal snailfish, that holds the record for the deepest living fish ever seen, at around 8,000 meters. We see spiky and sharp black rocks rush by as we sink down to more than 10,000. Until we reach the final slope, a trench inside the larger Mariana Trench with gently-sloping sides that enframe a valley about 1.6 kilometers wide. This is it. The deepest point, the Challenger Deep. 11,000 meters below the surface. The water pressure here is 1,086 bar. Taking a swim here is like having to balance 1,800 elephants on top of you. But even here, life has found a way to thrive. Next to sea cucumbers, white and light pink amphipods wiggle their way through the water. Their size is astounding. While their shallow-water cousins are merely a few centimetres long, the deep-sea version can reach up to 30 centimeters. And there are other things floating elegantly through the water. Plastic bags that were found by scientists in 2018. Even the remotest place on Earth is not safe from human influence. There's nothing left to do now and our oxygen is running out, so we begin our ascent. [♪ Deep Sea Ambience ♪] After hours of traveling through dark nothingness, we finally see a glimpse of light.

7_e0CA_nhaE,2019-08-11T12:30:00.000000,The World War of the Ants – The Army Ant,"Some groups just don't get along. Every day, billions of soldiers fight a merciless war on thousands of fronts, and it's been going on for over 100 million years. The World War of the Ants. [Music] Ants are ancient beings that arose around 160 million years ago and took over a wide variety of ecological niches so successfully that they became one of the dominant animals on planet Earth. Today, they count more than 16,000 different species with over 10,000 trillion individuals. Collectively, ants alone make up 20% of the entire animal biomass on land. Similar to humans, their recipe for success is collaboration. While a single ant is pretty useless, together, they are able to achieve stunning feats. They construct complex colonies, care for livestock, pursue agriculture, or have complex symbiotic relationships. And of course, ants wage war. Even among the same species, a constant state of conflict is pretty common. Skirmishes, raids, and full-on invasions are happening every day, causing millions of casualties. Let's look at some of the most interesting ones in a series of videos. In this one, the army ant, a swarm made for war. The army ant group consists of about 200 different species. Army ants do not build nests; they live a sort of nomadic lifestyle with groups of millions of individuals. On a hunt, some species form large columns up to 100 metres long, killing and immediately dismembering every insect or small vertebrate they encounter. The biggest hunting parties can kill up to 500,000 animals per day. Some army ants specialize in hunting and consuming other social insects, like termites, wasps, and especially other ants. Wasps are fierce and may seem invulnerable, but if a swarm makes its way to their colonies, they don't even stand a chance. The much bigger and stronger wasps might kill a few of them, but they are quickly overwhelmed. Even if their queen survives an attack, the army ants steal the colony's larvae and quickly devour them. There is no recovery from that. When army ants discover another ant colony, they immediately attack. Now you might think this would be a more even battle, but it's not. Because army ants act as a social unit, they are especially dangerous and effective. Most army ants are not particularly impressive individually, but they can overwhelm their victims with sheer numbers before the victim colony can mount an effective defense. And so invasions tend to be won by the attackers, and the prey colony is damaged significantly or is exterminated. Interestingly, army ants don't fight army ants. When two swarms encounter each other in the wild, they either pass through each other, ignoring the other swarm, or both colonies just move away, which makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint. Army ants that fought other army ants probably eradicated themselves millions of years ago. Indeed they're so deadly that other ant species had to specialize to survive their presence. Many species just panic and evacuate their nest when they notice army ant scouts, carrying as many larvae with them as they can, in order to return and rebuild after the attack. Other species have invented living bunkers since fighting is so futile. They have worker classes that have big square heads. When army ants show up, they use them to block the entrances to their nests, so the attackers have to give up after a while. But not everybody is afraid of army ants. Leafcutter ants form some of the largest and most complex societies of any animal other than humans. They live in extensive nests, many meters deep and across, harboring millions of citizens with a highly sophisticated division of labor. Like huge soldiers, 100 times more massive than a worker. Their sole purpose might be to defend their colonies against army ants. They still have a nemesis though. The diet of the army ant species Nomamyrmex esenbeckii consists mostly of the larvae of other ants. Compared to other army ants, they have a more robust soldier caste. So far, they are the only known species that can successfully attack a mature colony of leafcutters. When they find a leafcutter colony, hundreds of thousands attack in a long column. The moment the leafcutter ants notice the army ant attack, they go into crisis mode and immediately alert their soldiers, who very quickly swarm to the site of attack. A frontline develops that can be a few meters wide and up to a meter deep. The leafcutter soldiers go head-to-head with the army ants, locking on them and trying to cut through their heads. Smaller leaf cutter workers help by grabbing the enemies. Small teams carry out attacks behind the frontline, where they dismember their enemies by ripping their legs from their bodies. The attackers meanwhile try to swarm their victim's soldiers, and sting them to death in a mob. Despite the powerful defense and the determined response, the army ants are still superior in numbers. So without knowing if the battle can be won, the leafcutters prepare for the worst. Workers rush to create barricades and seal off as many entrances to their nest as possible to secure their route. If the leafcutters are not able to repel the invaders, or at least barricade enough of their entrances in time, the army ants swarm the nest, overrunning all opposition. They penetrate deep into the hidden chambers and steal tens of thousands of the leafcutters' brood to eat them. Even if the leaf cutter colony survives, this is a heavy blow. Regardless who's won the war, thousands lay slain on the battlefield. When the army ants attack, death follows them. But there are other species that form much more dangerous ant armies. Species that form supercolonies covering thousands of square kilometers over multiple continents engaging in wars kilometers across. They deserve their own video though. No matter the scale, war is a part of ant existence. Be it between huge colonies, or small groups trying to fend off a raid. In tropical rainforests, but also in the cracks of the concrete we walk over every day. Humans have decided that war is not a thing that they want to do a lot anymore. For ants though, the other ant will always be the enemy. No, some groups just don't get along."

FfgT6zx4k3Q,2019-07-07T12:31:14.000000,Could Your Phone Hurt You? Electromagnetic Pollution,"Electricity is all around us all the time.​ It makes our lives easier, safer, more fun,​ and most of us never think about it.​ But is there such a thing as too much electricity?​ Could the thing that is the foundation of the modern world​ slowly be killing us?​ Before we dive deeper,​ let's try to understand what electricity is,​ and how it affects us.​ Electricity is the movement of an electric charge.​ This movement generates ​​Electric​ and ​Magnetic Fields​ that spread out through space and carry energy.​ We call this phenomenon:​
​​​Electromagnetic Radiation​.​ Radiation is a word that makes people very nervous.​ But, to radiate just means, ""giving off"".​ Like when the radiator in your house gives off heat​ in the form of infrared radiation.​ Different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum​ correspond to different types of radiation.​ And, many of them are perfectly harmless.​ Some of them can be dangerous though.​ Radiation with very short wavelengths​ like UV Light, X-Rays, and Gamma Rays​ are strong enough to rip electrons out of their atoms,​ which can cause burns and genetic damage.​ This is what many people have in mind
when they hear the term ""radiation"".​ The rest of the spectrum covers
a large range of longer waves​ from Visible Light, Infrared,​ Microwaves, to Radio Waves.​ This is the kind of radiation that's
emitted by all sorts of human technology.​ Mobile phones, Wi-Fi routers,​ electric power lines, and household appliances.​ This radiation doesn't disrupt molecules in our body.​ However, some kinds of radiation
can stimulate muscles and nerves​ and can also make the hair on your body vibrate,​ which can sometimes cause a tingly feeling
above certain threshold values.​ Other kinds are useful for making dinner.​ Microwaves push the water molecules in your food around​ which warms it up.​ This happens to us all the time.​ For example, the pleasant warmth you feel at the beach​ is your skin heating up from exposure to​ electromagnetic infrared radiation from the sun.​ We are surrounded by natural, and generally harmless,​ sources of electromagnetic radiation all the time​ and always have been.​ But, since the Industrial Revolution,​ we have added a lot of it to our immediate environment.​ The question of whether this is actually dangerous​ first got public attention when a 1979 study​ linked leukemia to living near power lines.​ This particular study was quickly discredited though.​ The connection could not be explained​ and no direct causal link was confirmed.​ But once this had been proposed, the idea persisted.​ And the thousands of studies about possible dangers​ illustrate that it's still seen as a very real threat.​ A lot of people claim to be sensitive to the radiation​ coming from our appliances and cell phones.​ They report symptoms like headaches,​ nausea, skin reactions,​ burning eyes, or exhaustion.​ But those are just effects reported on a day-to-day basis.​ A few studies have found much more unsettling results.​ Like, possible connections between the side of the brain,​ which people use when they are on their phones,​ and the appearance of brain tumors.​ The question that science is trying to answer,​ is not so much about the acute effects of irradiation.​ We know, for example,​ that x-rays cause immediate damage to the DNA in your cells​ but that the same doesn't happen with radio waves.​ The question is rather:​ Is the sort of weak electromagnetic radiation
we are constantly surrounded by​ harmful in the long run as a result
of some as-yet-unknown mechanism?​ Answering this question was much harder than we first thought.​ There are thousands of primary sources,​ reports, and statements by an onslaught of different organizations.​ So, we read a lot for this video.​ You can take a look at our research in the video description.​ What we found is that this debate is a good example​ of how science should be communicated
and how it shouldn't.​ Many of the much-cited studies that spread panic
about electromagnetic radiation​ are highly controversial.​ For example,​ a series of population studies based on surveys and self-reporting.​ What this means is, for example,​ asking brain tumor patients how much they think
they used their phone in the last few years.​ The problem is that people are unreliable.​ We tend to misremember things or can be influenced easily.​ On top of this,​ studies or media reports may be cherry picking
the findings that best suit their opinion​ or make for the most exciting headline.​ For example,​ a study looking for cancer in rats and mice from cell phone radiation.​ The results seemed to show a connection.​ But, for some reason, only in male rats.​ And, none at all in mice.​ But it was ​​reported​ as if this study did prove​ that mobile phone radiation causes cancer.​ Unfortunately, this is the case for studies
with both positive and negative findings on the issue.​ Another aspect, is that the WHO did
officially classify radio frequency fields​ as possibly carcinogenic.​ But what this actually means​ is that there are some hints that they might cause cancer,​ but we can't prove it, and that we will keep an eye out.​ So, if we zoom out a bit, what's the big picture?​ On the whole,​ there was no consistent evidence in human studies​ that electromagnetic radiation below
exposure value limits causes health problems.​ There are some statistical associations​ but they're mostly weak and inconsistent.​ If there were any definite cause-effect relations​ we would know by now because of all the data we have.​ So, based on the current state of science,​ should you worry about the radiation
from your laptop, or cell phone, or TV?​ The answer is no.​ You shouldn't.​ But what about the people who say it ​​is​ harming them?​ Research show they could be experiencing​
​what's known as the ​​Nocebo Effect​.​ If you have a headache and happen to start
feeling better right when you switch off your laptop,​ you might see a connection between those two things.​ Once you get this suspicion, the idea alone
that weak radiation might harm you​ could be the very thing harming you.​ It's easy to belittle these people;​ most of them feel they're not being taken seriously,​ which makes the situation even worse for them.​ They should get support.​ But, it's important to be aware that, so far,​ we have no robust evidence that electricity below
safety limits has any negative effect on humans.​ In the attention economy we live in,​ talking about unproven dangers can make us
neglect things that we know for sure are bad for us.​ Just one example:​ Outdoor air pollution is linked to
4.2 million premature deaths each year,​ and is definitely something
we could have a real impact on today.​ Still, to make people feel safe, and just to make sure,​ there are several long-term studies ongoing already.​ For example, the Cosmos study that will look
at the possible health impacts of cell phone use​ by exactly measuring frequency and duration of phone calls.​ But while we wait for the conclusion of these long-term studies,​ there are a lot more pressing problems to focus on.​"
ouAccsTzlGU,2019-06-09T12:28:46.000000,Is Meat Bad for You? Is Meat Unhealthy?,"When our vegetarian ancestors started
eating meat around two million years ago, it wasn't just because animals taste great, it was pure necessity. Climate change made many of the plants our ancestors
relied on less available and meat bridged that gap. From the discovery of fire at the latest,
meat became a staple of the human diet. But over the last few years eating meat has
increasingly been associated with health risks like: heart disease, certain cancers, and an early death. So how unhealthy is meat, really? In this video we'll only talk about meat. Dairy products deserve a video of their own. Biologically, we need to eat for three reasons: for energy, to acquire materials to fabricate our cells, and to get special molecules
that our bodies can't make themselves. The energy and most of the materials come from the
three macronutrients: fats, carbohydrates and proteins. Proteins are the most important resource for
repairing and replenishing our cell structures. The special molecules are a large variety of vitamins
and minerals we need to drive metabolic processes. Meat provides us with most of these things. It contains all essential amino acids
our body needs and a lot of minerals like: iron, zinc and essential vitamins, some of which are
barely found in plants like Vitamin B12. Only one essential nutrient is missing
in most of the meat we consume: vitamin C. It appears in almost all plants
and supports our immune system as well as the development of connective tissues. After a few months without it you'd get scurvy. But meat has another big advantage,
it's high bioavailability. Some of the nutrients in meat are broken down
faster and available quicker than those from plants. Spinach for example, contains more iron than meat,
but it's absorbed much slower and the body needs more energy to digest it. Several health benefits have also been
observed in communities that rely solely on meat. The Inuit for example, are able to survive in extreme
climate conditions thanks to a purely meat-based diet. Since they consume the whole animal including
the organs, they get every single nutrient they need including vitamin C. So meat itself is definitely not dangerous for us. But its health effects vary, depending on
how its prepared and what animal it comes from. When talking about meat in the Western world, we generally mean muscle tissues
that have a high nutrient density, but also lack some of the vitamins that 
make it possible to survive on meat alone. The most healthy animals to eat are probably fish. Fish contains polyunsaturated fatty acids like omega-3, which may lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases
and support anti-inflammatory immune functions. As part of a balanced diet,
fish can be eaten regularly without worries. Eating fish comes with its own bag of complications though, like overfishing and the destruction of the oceans. We'll talk about that in another video. A close second is the most popular meat, chicken. It's regarded as the meat with the fewest health risks. The only negative health effect
of poultry is a bit controversial: fat. It's high content of saturated fats is associated with a
higher cholesterol level and cardiovascular disease. But this idea has also been criticized
by a large number of scientists arguing high cholesterol levels might be
inherited and not caused by nutrition. So in general, if you want meat and are
concerned about your health, go for chicken. Things start to get problematic with high intakes of
red meats like beef, veal, pork, lamb, horse and goat. A recently published study recommends for
example a maximum of 23 grams of red meat per day which is a very small steak per week. However, large-scale meta-analysis studies have shown that eating 100 grams of red meat every day increases the risk of diabetes by 19%,
of strokes by 11% and of colorectal cancer by 17%. This sounds alarming. But before we panic,
let's have a look at how these studies were conducted. Because this brings us to the second big problem
when trying to answer the question of whether meat is unhealthy or not. Most studies that linked health risks to
eating red meat were case-control studies. Which means taking a group of people with a disease
and classifying them by their eating habits. The more red meat they consume, the more likely
they were to contract certain diseases. The problem is that it's very hard
to eliminate other factors. People who eat less meat tend to
live a healthier lifestyle in general. They tend to eat more vegetables and fruit
and are less likely to smoke and drink alcohol. Most studies try to eliminate these factors,
but it's extremely hard to make definitive statements. Things get worse when
we look at processed meat though. Processing meat means adding certain chemicals by curing, smoking, sorting or fermenting or in other words making it delicious. Bacon, ham, salami, sausages and hot dogs
contain chemicals that are harmful for us like nitrates and nitrites that can damage the DNA
in our digestive system and lead to cancer. The w-h-o reviewed 800 studies over 20 years, and concluded that processed wheat is strongly
linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Each extra 50 grams of processed meat per day
increases your risk of cancer by 18 percent. When it comes to cancer risk, processed meat is now in the same category as plutonium, asbestos and smoking. The w-h-o highlights that it's research is
only about the question of whether or not something causes cancer and not to what extent. But processed meat may also significantly
increase the chance of suffering from diabetes, strokes and coronary heart diseases. It also makes a difference what sort of life
our meat lived when it was still part of a living being. It's common to feed large
amounts of antibiotics to livestock in order to prevent diseases
which can spread antibiotic resistance. Combined, a high consumption of
both red and processed meat could increase your chance of
premature death by up to 29%. This means if your chance of dying
is at 3% this year, it's now 4%. This might not sound like a lot but tiny percentages
have a huge impact on societies of millions. They also seem harmless until they affect you. To blame meat alone for
bad health would be wrong though. There is no evidence that the very essence of meat
has any negative effect beyond it's high fat content. And even this point is highly contentious. Just like with many other pleasures in life,
sometimes too much of a good thing is harmful. Most public health agencies suggest cutting
meat consumption to 500 grams a week while studies suggest cutting down
processed meat as much as possible. So if you feast on meat no more than once
or twice a week, you should be good. For most people this already means
a drastic change in their diets though, The average American consumes around
almost 1600 grams of meat a week. The average German 1100 grams a week. And many of us needs much much more. If you're not really sure, make a small note
whenever you eat meat for a week or two. You'll be surprised how much it really is. So most people watching this video
would benefit from cutting down on meat. Aside from health concerns, there's still the fact that the meat industry is
one of the largest contributors to climate change and has reached a scale where it's
impossible to deliver millions of tons of meat and still treat animals with dignity. We've already discussed that in detail in another video. All in all, in moderation, meat is not unhealthy
and you don't need to become vegetarian overnight to have a real impact on your health and the planet. But your lifestyle choices do matter. For yourself and for others."
h4Uu5eyN6VU,2019-05-19T12:30:02.000000,Is the EU Democratic? Does Your Vote Matter?,"Being a citizen 
of the European Union means that many aspects 
of our lives are regulated 
by a weird entity. It feels like a huge bureaucracy
is making decisions over our heads. Many Europeans think that their vote 
in the EU elections doesn't count, and that the EU 
is not democratic. How democratic 
is the EU really? And, does your vote 
actually achieve anything? In democratic states, public policies are based 
on the will of the people. But, the people are not a coherent thing. Countless different groups
are battling for influence and power to establish laws 
and rules that benefit them. In a working democracy, there are checks 
and balances that are supposed 
to create a fair environment where these battles 
can be fought. Term limits stop factions 
from dominating too much. But all of this ends 
at our borders. International politics 
are not democratic, but anarchic. No central authority is powerful enough
to ensure fairness, or enforce laws, so the only law is the tyranny
of the strongest, and anarchy. So for most of human history, powerful countries
took what they wanted from others either by extortion or by violence. After World War Two, the United Nations
were founded to overcome this anarchy by establishing rules 
on how countries should behave. But since the UN has 
virtually no power, and its members 
often have opposing interests, it's usually politely ignored. The EU is a construct that tries
to have rules and laws for its member nations that are actually enforceable, as the European Court
of Justice is able to make binding decisions. Originally, the EU was founded
to ensure peace between European nations and prosperity 
for the continent. But it's also an attempt
to gain international power for its members. It's like a super state and it's striving to be democratic
and legitimized by all of its citizens. To do that, it has to solve the problem of
different actors wanting different things. Only, that its members
are countries with very different priorities. So, how does this work? Since the EU 
is ridiculously complex, and politicians are even worse 
than scientists at naming things, we'll simplify massively and omit 
a lot of details. You can find further reading
and explanations in our Sources Document. OK, if you want to create
a democratic union of independent nations, you have two options. you have two options. One: Let everybody vote 
for national politicians who then make decisions 
for the Union together. Or, two: Let every citizen vote directly for an independent
institution that's able to make 
binding decisions. Both approaches have 
their upsides and downsides, and the EU ended up 
with a mix of both of them. Next to the European 
Court of Justice, there are four main institutions 
that we'll talk about today. The European Council, which is made up of the heads of government
or states of the member countries. The Council of the EU, with ministers 
from the member countries. The third one is 
the European Commission, which is the de facto 
government of the EU, having one Commissioner 
for each member state. And, lastly, the European Parliament. The Parliament 
is the only part of the EU that is directly elected 
by you, dear Citizen, in the European elections. In principle, all of these institutions of the EU
originate from your direct or indirect vote, be it at the national or EU level. But some 
do more than others. For example, you vote for 
your national representative and therefore contribute 
to form a national government whose head of state has a seat 
in the European Council. These leaders choose the president of
the EU Commission and its fellow commissioners, who eventually are confirmed 
by the EU Parliament. So, this is a sort of 
indirect democracy. You didn't vote for the Commission, but you voted for the people 
who appointed them and for those who confirmed 
and police them. So, in effect, 2.5 of the 4
main European Union institutions depend on the member state governments. But since you, as a citizen,
can only directly vote for the European Parliament, the question is, ""​How powerful is it?"" How much influence 
does your vote have? The European Parliament
started out with very little influence but has become more and more
powerful over the past two decades. Today, it has 
to approve new laws which can be binding 
for the member countries. It also votes on how 
the EU budget is spent and on international treaties. All of this makes 
the Parliament very powerful and, thus, your vote 
very influential, even on an international level. Compared to national parliaments,
one major power is still missing though. The EU Parliament officially
can't propose new laws on its own which is often the core of the argument
the EU is not Democratic enough and that the European Parliament
should be given more influence. Right now, the member states' governments
pretty much control the European Union. Giving the Parliament more power would make
the EU, as a whole, more democratic but it would also take power 
from member states. It's not clear 
which approach is better. Ultimately it's for the Member States and us as citizens
to decide how the Union should develop. OK, so can we draw 
a conclusion here? As a whole, the EU is not as democratic 
as most of its member states. But it is democratic. If you don't like decisions they make, regarding copyright, for example, you can look up what your representatives
voted for and vote them out. The struggle to make it 
more democratic is closely tied 
to who holds power over what. The EU keeps changing. You, dear Citizen, are not only voting 
on the current politics but also on what the system 
will look like in the future. There are many parties and politicians
that vow to make the EU Parliament, and therefore 
your vote, stronger. Many others want 
to keep it as it is, or even diminish it. It's for you to decide what you think
is better for the future of the Union. Currently, it's equally important
for the EU who you vote for at home, because these are the people who have
the most influence in the European Union right now. Opinion At home is also where the EU 
is often used as a scapegoat. Politicians, especially 
before national elections, like to pretend the EU is all-powerful and mix up rules and laws
over the heads of the governments and citizens. Although, often, they were
directly responsible for what the EU did. Democracy is annoying and complicated, and often very boring. In the European Union, even more so 
than in the Member States. But, voting and caring about
how our political institutions change and develop is one of the most powerful things 
we can do as citizens. The last few years have shown that
extreme things can happen through elections. We have to decide if we want
to be an active part of this process. If we don't take part in the struggle
for power that is politics, others will. And we might not like 
what they decide for us. Because Europe is 
an important topic for us, we've translated this video
into as many European languages as possible. A couple of European YouTubers narrated it, and uploaded it 
to their own channels. Thank you to Funk and all YouTubers who helped us. You can find the playlist

zBkVCpbNnkU,2019-05-12T12:30:04.000000,The Side Effects of Vaccines - How High is the Risk?,"Vaccines are celebrated
for their part in fighting disease. But, a growing group of people seem to believe that they endanger
our health, instead of protecting it. The Internet is full of stories
about allergic reactions, the onset of disabilities, and even death following
vaccination appointments. And, it's true vaccines can have side effects. Let's look at how they work,
and how dangerous they really are. Your immune system is a
complex army of billions of cells. Soldiers, intelligence cells, and weapons factories. Every day, you're attacked countless times, but your immune soldiers alone
usually deal with that, so you don't even notice. If an infection becomes serious though, our intelligence cells gather
intel about the attackers and activate our weapons factories. You know the weapon: antibodies. They're like targeted missiles produced
specifically to combat the invader. Unfortunately, this process takes
several days to complete. That gives intruders
a lot of time to do damage. Contrary to popular wisdom, what doesn't kill you doesn't make you stronger. Our bodies really don't want
to fight serious wars over and over, so our immune system came up
with an ingenious way to get stronger and stronger over time. If we fight an enemy that is dangerous
enough to trigger our heavy weapons, our immune system automatically
creates memory cells. Memory cells remain in our body
for years, in a deep sleep. They do nothing but remember. When an enemy attacks for a second time, the slumbering memory cells awaken, and order coordinated attacks
and the production of antibodies. This is so fast and effective, that many infections you beat once
will never make you sick again. You might even be immune
against them forever. Which is also why little kids are constantly ill; they don't have enough memory cells yet. And this beautiful natural mechanism
is what we build on when we use vaccines. How Vaccines Work As great as memory cells are, obtaining them through an infection
is unpleasant and sometimes dangerous. Vaccines are a way of tricking
our bodies into making memory cells, and becoming immune to a disease. They pretend to be a dangerous infection. One way of doing this is to inject
invaders that can't do harm. For example, by killing them,
or by ripping them into pieces. Our immune systems deal with
these kinds of vaccines pretty easily. Sometimes, it's necessary to make
our immune system work harder though, to produce even more memory cells. Live vaccines are the real deal. An enemy that can punch back is
a bigger challenge than a dead one. But this also sounds like
a sort-of horrible idea. What if the germs win? To avoid that, we breed a sort-of
weak cousin of the real germ in the lab. Just powerful enough to annoy the immune
system, and create enough memory cells. Okay, so these are the basic
principles of vaccine use. They provoke a natural reaction in our bodies that makes us become immune
against very dangerous diseases. Some, like the flu virus, mutate so often that we need a new vaccine every year, but most vaccines protect us
for years, or even a lifetime. But, there's a catch. Like everything in life,
vaccines have another side: Side effects. What are they, and what happens
if your child develops one? The Risks of Vaccines It's complicated to directly compare the side
effects of vaccines with the effects of diseases. For example, hundreds of millions of people are
vaccinated against measles in the West, but there were only 83,000
cases in Europe in 2018. So, with numbers that different,
even mild side effects can seem scary compared to the bad effects of a disease
that we don't see as much anymore. Before the measles vaccine
became available in 1963, virtually every single child on Earth
contracted measles at some point. An estimated 135 million cases in the 1950s. Every single year. But are measles really that
dangerous in the year 2019? With our advanced healthcare
and new technologies, are they worth the risk of vaccine side effects? Let's do a thought experiment
based on real numbers. Imagine a developed country
in a parallel world. It has good healthcare but
people stop vaccinating. In this scenario, let's say ten
million children caught measles. What happens? Nine million eight hundred thousand, or 98%,
will get a high fever and a very unpleasant rash. Up to 800,000 of them, or 8%,
will suffer from dangerous diarrhea. 700,000, or 7%, will suffer from an ear infection,
which can lead to permanent hearing loss. 600,000 kids, or 6%, will suffer from pneumonia
-- the most dangerous effect of measles. It, alone, will kill 12,000 children. Up to 10,000 children, or 0.1%,
will get encephalitis. 2,500 kids, or 0.025%, will contract SSPE, a disease where the measles
virus lingers in their brain and kills them a few years later. Taken together, around 2.5 million children will suffer from
somewhat serious effects from measles. And, about 20,000 children
will be killed by measles. It doesn't stop here though. The kids who beat measles are left with
a severely damaged immune system that needs a lot of time to regenerate. Time for other diseases to do further damage. Aside from that, what's almost guaranteed is that your kids will have a really
bad time for about two weeks. Okay, but what about vaccines? It's only fair to look at these risks, too. So, let's repeat our thought experiment. But, this time, we vaccinate ten
million children with MMR. What would theoretically happen here? After being vaccinated, of our 10 million kids,
around ten percent get a fever. 500,000, or 5%, will get a mild rash. Up to 100, or 0.001%, might have a serious allergic reaction
and will have to be treated. Up to ten boys, or 0.0001%, might get inflammation of the genitalia. And up to ten kids in total, or 0.0001%, might get the most serious
side effect: encephalitis. So, we vaccinated ten million kids. In total, around one hundred and twenty had
side effects that were somewhat serious. Thanks to good medical treatment in developed
regions, almost all of them will be fine. What about autism? The connection of autism and vaccines
stems from one source that has been disproven countless times. We'll link to further reading
and videos in the description. But, in 2019, it's fair to say that
vaccines do not cause autism. All right, but what about deaths? It's really hard to say if even a single one of
our 10 million vaccinated kids would die. We really did look hard and
talked to a lot of different experts. If we ignore self-reporting, we could only come up with a tiny
handful of documented cases for all the hundreds of millions of children
who received the MMR vaccine since 1971. Measles are many, many thousands of
times more dangerous for your child than even the absolute worst
case of vaccine side effects. You have to search for lethal vaccine side
effects with a huge magnifying glass and, even then, it's very hard
to find confirmed cases. While, deaths from measles
are real and easy to find. In 2017 alone, 110,000 people
died from measles worldwide. Statistically, today,
300 children will die of measles. One since this video started. You can compare vaccines to seatbelts. Are there weird freak accidents where
someone gets killed by their seatbelt? Well, yes. But, do you personally think it's safer
to not put a seatbelt on your kid? Wait a second! What if your kid is actually allergic? What if none of the things we've said
applies to your specific situation? In this case, you need to become the
greatest vaccination promoter of all. Because if your children can't be vaccinated,
only the collective can protect them. This is called herd immunity, and it's the only thing that
can protect your unvaccinated child. Herd immunity means that enough
people are immune to a disease, that it can't spread, and dies
before it reaches its victims. But to accomplish this for measles alone, 95% of the people around you
need to be vaccinated. Conclusion The problem with the debate about vaccines
is that it's not fought on a level playing field. While the pro-vaccine side argues
with studies and statistics, the arguments against them are
usually a wild mixture of gut feeling, anecdotes, and misinformation. And feelings are often immune to facts. We'll not convince anybody
by screaming at them. But we can't hide from the reality
of what anti-vaccine conspiracies do. They kill babies too young to be vaccinated. They kill healthy children that are just unlucky. They bring serious diseases back
from the verge of extinction. And, the biggest side effect
of vaccines is fewer dead children. Vaccines are one of
the most powerful tools we have to eradicate the monsters that
most of us have already forgotten. Let's not bring the beasts back! Vaccines are celebrated

p_8yK2kmxoo,2019-04-14T12:30:02.000000,The Most Dangerous Stuff in the Universe - Strange Stars Explained,"Neutron stars are the densest things that are not black holes. In their cores, we might find the most dangerous substance in existence: Strange matter. A bizarre thing so extreme, that it bends the rules of the universe and could infect and destroy everything it comes into contact with-- --or it could teach us about how the universe began. Maybe both. [Intro music] To understand how extreme strange matter really is, we first need to get a few basics. What is a neutron star, and how does strange matter break the rules of the universe? To get all of this into one video, we'll grossly oversimplify a few things, but we'll provide you with further reading if you want more details. A neutron star is what remains after a very massive star explodes in a supernova. When this happens, the star's core collapses under its own gravity with such a strong inward force that it squeezes nuclei and particles together violently. Electrons are pushed into protons, so they merge and turn into neutrons. All the ""nothing"" inside of atoms is suddenly completely filled with particles that really don't want to be close to each other, but have no choice. They desperately push back against gravity, against the collapse. If gravity wins, they will become a black hole. If they win, they become a neutron star. This makes neutron stars like giant atomic nuclei the size of a city, but holding the mass of our Sun. And here, things get weird. The environment in the core of neutron stars is so extreme that the rules of nuclear physics change. And this could lead to a strange and extremely dangerous substance. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. We first need to know the rules before we learn how they can be broken. Protons and neutrons, the particles making up the nuclei of atoms, are made up of smaller particles called quarks. Quarks really don't want to be alone. They are what we call confined. You can try to separate them, but the harder you pull, the harder they try to pull themselves back together. If you use a lot of energy, they just use this energy to create new quarks. Quarks only exist together as the building blocks of other particles and have never been observed by themselves. They come in many types, but only two appear to make stable matter: the 'up' and 'down' quarks found in protons and neutrons. All other quarks seem to decay away quickly, but this may be different inside neutron stars. The forces operating in their cores are so extreme that they are actually similar to the universe shortly after the Big Bang. Neutron star cores are like fossils, which can let us peer back in time to the beginning of everything. So learning how quarks behave inside a neutron star is a way of understanding the very nature of the universe itself. One hypothesis is that, inside a neutron star core, protons and neutrons deconfine. All the particles crammed shoulder-to-shoulder dissolve and melt into a sort of bath of quarks. Uncountable numbers of particles become one giant thing made purely from quarks: Quark matter. A star made from this is called a Quark Star. Though from the outside, it may not look any different than a regular neutron star. Now, we can finally talk about the most dangerous substance. If the pressure inside a quark star is great enough, it may get stranger, literally. In the cores of neutron stars, some of the quarks may be converted into 'strange' quarks. Strange quarks have bizarre nuclear properties, and they are heavier, and for the lack of a better word, stronger. If they turn up, they could create strange matter. Strange matter might be the ideal state of matter, perfectly dense, perfectly stable, indestructible, more stable than any other matter in the universe. So stable that it can exist outside neutron stars. If this is the case, we have a problem. It might be infectious. Every piece of matter it touches might be so impressed by its stability that it would immediately turn into strange matter, too. Protons and neutrons would dissolve and become part of the quark bath, which frees energy and creates more strange matter. The only way to get rid of it would be to throw it into a black hole. But then again, who cares? All of it is inside neutron stars, except when neutron stars collide with other neutron stars or black holes. They spew out tremendous amounts of their insides, some of which could include little droplets of strange matter called strangelets. Strangelets are as dense as the core of a neutron star. They could be really small, maybe even subatomic, but even the largest strangelets wouldn't be any bigger than a rocket. These strangelets would drift through the galaxy for millions or billions of years until they meet a star or planet by chance. If one were to strike earth, it would immediately start converting it into strange matter. The more it converts, the more it would grow. Ultimately, all of the atoms making up earth would be converted. Earth would become a hot clump of strange matter, the size of an asteroid. If a strangelet strikes the sun, it would collapse into a strange star, eating through it like fire through a dry forest. This would not change the Sun's mass much, but it would become way less bright. So Earth would freeze to death. And like a tiny virus, we'd have no way to see a strangelet coming. Worse still, some theories suggest strangelets are more than common, outnumbering all stars in the galaxy. The strangelets could've formed very early after the Big Bang, when it was as hot and dense as a neutron star core everywhere. They might be clumping around the gravity of galaxies as the universe expanded and evolved. Strangelets could even be so numerous and massive, that they might actually be the dark matter we suspect holds galaxies together. But then again, maybe not. This is speculation. And the Earth and Sun and planets haven't been consumed in a wildfire of strangelets in the past few billion years. So the odds seem good that it won't happen any time soon. Understanding these strange objects today may be the key to understanding the birth of our universe, and why it grew to look the way it does now. When scientists first started playing with magnets and wires and thinking about electrons, they had no idea how technology would evolve in the next hundred years. The scientists thinking about the cause of neutron stars and strange matter today may be setting up humans for a future beyond our wildest imaginations ...or maybe not. Time will tell..."
JyECrGp-Sw8,2019-03-31T12:30:00.000000,What If We Detonated All Nuclear Bombs at Once?,"Many of our viewers have asked us
a very serious question: What if we made a big pile of bombs and exploded every nuclear weapon
in the world all at once? Strangely enough, we couldn't find a good source to answer this question to our satisfaction. So, we gathered together a few scientists
to calculate what would happen. And find an answer to this extremely
important scientific problem, once and for all. Currently, there are 15,000 nuclear weapons on Earth. The US and Russia both have around 7,000, while France, China, the UK,
Pakistan, India, Israel, and North Korea own around 1,000 between them. But, how much destructive power is this really? Let's try to put these numbers into perspective. On Earth, there are about 4,500 cities or urban areas with at least 100,000 inhabitants. Some are bigger than others,
so we'll assume that on average, we need three nuclear bombs to completely wipe out one city. This means we could destroy
every single city on planet Earth, with our nuclear arsenal, killing more than three billion people
-- roughly half of humanity in an instant. And, we'd still have 1,500 nuclear weapons left. Now that's what an expert would call, ""overkill."" So, we can say with confidence,
that we have a lot of nuclear weapons and they can do a lot of damage. But, what if we make a huge pile
of all 15,000 bombs and pull the trigger? Let's drop our nuclear pile in the middle of the Amazon rainforest; just a show nature who's boss. Our warheads, piled haphazardly,
fit into a small warehouse. A typical US warhead has the power
of two hundred thousand tons of TNT. So, fifteen thousand warheads would be
the equivalent of three billion tons of TNT. For scale, this is enough
to rebuild the whole island of Manhattan with every building and skyscraper using stacks of TNT. The closest thing we can compare
to the energy gathered here, is a volcano. One of the deadliest volcanic eruptions
in recorded history took place in 1883, on the island of Krakatoa. The eruption was so powerful, that 70% of the island, and the surrounding archipelago, was destroyed killing tens of thousands of people. Its effects were felt around
the world for days after the event. Our nuclear pile contains 15 times
the energy of the Krakatoa volcanic eruption. So, let's finally push the button. Three, two, one. In a second, a fireball 50 kilometers across
vaporizes everything in its way, and creates a blast wave that flattens
3,000 square kilometers of forest. Every living thing within
250 kilometers will start to burn. The explosion will be heard literally around the world, as the pressure wave circles the Earth
tens of times over the next few weeks. Millions of tons of incinerated material
are catapulted into the atmosphere. The mushroom cloud reaches
the outer reaches of the stratosphere, pushing up against space itself. After things have calmed down, a small crater -- about ten kilometers across is left in the center of the worst
world fires the planet has seen in millennia, spreading throughout South America,
burning down forests and cities alike. And, now, the unpleasant part begins. Extremely radioactive material
will kill living things very quickly, and a large area several kilometers
around the crater is now uninhabitable, as is everywhere for hundreds of kilometers downwind. Much of the fallout is carried high
into the atmosphere by the mushroom cloud and carried around the planet. The amount of radioactive material
in the environment doubles worldwide, which still isn't civilization-ending,
but we may see more cancer for a while. A portion of the particles will flow
to the edge of space for years and cause a nuclear winter that could lower global temperatures
by a few degrees for a few years. This explosion was pretty bad if
you're in South America, and especially Brazil. The Amazon rainforest is pretty much history, which is not great. But, human life will go on. OK, but what if we explode more nuclear weapons? Let's suppose humanity decided
to mine every bit of uranium on Earth and build as many nuclear bombs as possible. At current usage, it's estimated that there are around
35 million tons of uranium in Earth's crust; enough to power human civilization for over 2,000 years, or to build millions of nuclear warheads. For the sake of argument, let's say we create a pile
with the yield of 10 billion Hiroshima bombs, which makes up a cube three kilometers high
that contains roughly the energy of the asteroid impact that ended
the age of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Except, it's also nuclear. Three, two, one. Our pile explodes in a fireball
stretching so high into the sky that it's visible from half of South America, with so much power that
the ground just splashes like water forming a crater 100 kilometers across. Bedrock on the scale of whole mountain ranges
is vaporized in an instant, while thousands of tons of material
is catapulted away with such speed, that it's ejected into space. Some leaves Earth forever, while most of it comes raining down
as hot, burning debris that heats up the atmosphere
to oven-like temperatures, killing most big animals
and causing fire storms all over the world. The Earth's crust rings like a bell struck by global earthquakes
stronger than anything in recorded history, decimating cities around the world, while hurricane-force winds flatten
every single tree in South America, and wildfires consume the continent. The abundance of hydrocarbons
in the Amazon burn to form ash, are cast into the atmosphere, darting the sky and keeping sunlight from reaching the surface, dropping temperatures to near freezing worldwide. The ensuing global winter may last for decades, and results in the extinction
of every large animal species, humans included. We could also mention that every corner
of the planet is covered with radioactive fallout, but at this point, it doesn't matter that much anymore. This is humanity's extinction event. The astronauts aboard the International Space Station
get to enjoy a great view for a while, but it's not unlikely that the spray
of rocks blast into orbit will destroy the Station. Those lucky enough to be in bunkers,
or in submarines deep below the ocean surface, may survive the longest
before they exhaust their food supplies, and have to venture out for more. They'll find the world a
charred, freezing, radioactive wasteland. The planet, itself, doesn't care at all. After just a few million years,
the wounds of the explosions have healed and life is thriving, arguably even more so
than when humans were around. If intelligent life emerges again,
it might be able to work out what happened. When they study geology,
they'll find a bizarre and very thin layer of rock covering the entire world,
enriched in radioactive elements like uranium, and the other nasty things it decays to, mixed with rare earth metals
and plastics that humans used. They would probably be very, very confused."
H6u0VBqNBQ8,2019-03-17T13:30:12.000000,The Origin of Consciousness – How Unaware Things Became Aware,"Consciousness is perhaps the biggest riddle in nature. Stripped to its core meaning, consciousness is what allows us to be aware
both of our surroundings and of our own inner state. But thinking about consciousness has
this habit of taking us round in circles. We all intuitively know what consciousness is. It's this... It's what you're experiencing here, right now. But once we try to pinpoint just what exactly it is,
it leaves us grasping at thin air. And not just us, philosophers and scientists
struggle to define consciousness. Different schools and ideas compete with one another,
but no one has come close to figuring it out. It's unsettling to realise that we don't understand
what makes us aware of ourselves and the world. In this fuzzy area, consciousness and intelligence
are also related, although they are not the same. We'll talk in greater depth about theories of consciousness and intelligence in other videos. Like much of what makes us human, our consciousness is likely to have
evolved from less complex forms, as a product of evolution by natural selection. It has probably emerged from an immense several
100 million years sequence of countless micro steps, that together make up a sort of
gradient of consciousness. What was the first step on this
path from the non-conscious to the basic consciousness that ultimately led to the convoluted consciousness we humans enjoy today? [Intro] Take a stone. The consensus is that a stone is not conscious.
Though, not everyone agrees even on this. Some panpsychists claim that
a lump of rock may have an inner life. However, there are no real grounds for any such
assumption since stones never show behaviour. Their inner life can neither be proven nor disproven. A more common starting point is with the living things. A living thing, or a self, is a part of the universe
that sustains itself and makes more of its kind. To do so, it needs energy. And this is where an awareness
of the world comes in handy. The original function of consciousness was probably
to direct a mobile self that was short of energy to a fresh supply of food. On the smaller scales of life,
you don't need to be aware to find food. Trichopax adhaerens - one of the simplest
of all animals moves around haphazardly. It slows down in the presence of food,
and speeds up in its absence. This is highly effective, and makes the tiny creature
spend more time where there is food spend more time where there is food
than where there is not. But it never moves in a particular 
direction towards a particular target, and there's no need for it to be
conscious of its environment. The first major step towards consciousness was probably taken when mobile selves
started to move themselves directionally. Moving towards what was good for them, 
say food, and away from what was less good, say someone else who thought that they were food. Take Dugesia tigrina - a tiny worm
known for its funny face. Sometimes the worm is hungry, and sometimes not. This means that when it moves, the worm self is not simply producing an
automatic response to an external stimulus, but that its actions depend
upon its inner, physiological state, whether it's hungry or sated. When it's just eaten,
the worm is less energetic, but when starved for a while,
it will move itself in the direction of tasty things. It uses chemoreceptors on its head
to smell its environment, and guide it in the direction
where the scent of food is strongest. After finding and eating a meal, our worm buddy heads
back to a dark sheltered spot to digest it in safety, until it's hungry again. But animals that blindly follow their sense of smell
don't have a concrete objective in view. They still lack any sense of where they are heading. So, the next step on the ladder of consciousness
is to add some perception at a distance, like vision. Vision adds context and depth to our world. With vision comes a sense of
the space we and our food exists in. It adds a whole new dimension to awareness, and is
a huge step towards more familiar consciousness. An optical apparatus, like an eye, enables
us to visualise our goal and lock onto it. But even at this stage, a self is only able
to pursue its food as long as it sees it. So, the next logical step needs
to happen on the inside. To visualise food in its absence, for example, a self needs to create some sort of
inner representation of the world. Now, an animal can continue looking for food,
even when it escapes its sensory range. Because of this inner representation
of what is relevant in the world, it can remain focused on its food and its desire to get it. Our self now exists in a world it can get familiar with. The ability to remember things has emerged. Thanks to memory, animals can be
distracted from the pursuit for a few seconds, but quickly continue their path afterwards. A related phenomenon is called 'object permanence'. This describes our awareness that things
continue to exist even when we can't see them. This cognitive skill is enjoyed by some mammals
and birds, and perhaps other animals too. Human babies tend to develop this ability
around the time they turn eight months, while baby chickens show this ability
within a day or two of being born. The capacity to remember a thing in its absence
suggests at least a basic sense of time. A sense of time is a big step
on the ladder of consciousness. It may also enable a self to look forward
from the present moment and anticipate the future. Adult chickens, for example, are able to resist a meal put
in front of them if they expect to receive a bigger meal as a prize for holding back for a while. This sort of delayed gratification means there is an
ability to visualize a reward that only exists in the future, which can be quite a challenge even for adult humans. Western scrub jays are experts in delayed gratification. They show an even more elaborate sense
of the future when they hide food in a cache to retrieve it at a later date. The scrub jays will even rehide their food if they become aware that a potential thief has been watching them. This means that they know
that there are other hungry selves out there, who are aware and see the world
from their own, different perspective. Crafty scrub jays can sort of
read the mind of their fellow birds. This ability to mind-read is crucial
for complex levels of consciousness. By putting yourself in the position of others,
you can outsmart a rich competitor, or empathise with a hungry friend. Language takes the ability to read minds
and represent what is absent to a whole new level. Words enable us to construct
hypotheses about the world, make detailed plans, and to
communicate them with others. Words enable us to think about ourselves
and our place in the universe, and even about our own consciousness, which is something we'll be doing more in future videos. So, what is the origin of our consciousness? It probably began as the directed motion
of a hungry self towards a source of food. With the survival benefits, this gave it over 
competitors that moved at random or not at all. It probably all started with the urge for more food. So, even with the sophisticated consciousness
that allows us to dream about space, build skyscrapers, or obsess about novels, it's not surprising that we can't stop thinking
about where we'll get our next meal. Collectively, we've put so much thought
and ingenuity into getting food, that we can now just get our food to
come to us with little conscious effort. This video is part one of a three-part video series
relating to big questions of life and the universe, made possible by a grant from the
Templeton World Charity Foundation. You can find our sources and

JtUAAXe_0VI,2019-03-03T13:30:28.000000,Can You Trust Kurzgesagt Videos?,"Can you trust Kurzgesagt videos? To answer this question,
we'll first explain how we research them and then talk a bit about past videos, and what we want to achieve with the channel. Making a Kurzgesagt video
always begins with a question or an issue. For example, after our meat video, many viewers asked about the health effects of meat on humans. We had no idea, and were pretty curious too, so we just decided to work on it. The first step is research. We start by looking for books
and scientific papers to get an overview, and just read a lot. The plan is to find a story worth telling. Is there something surprising to learn? Is there a larger context or a new perspective, or will it be an overview or introduction? Once we have the first readable version, we reach out to experts or scientists, and ask them to fact check and correct us. Often enough, they find a flaw or point us in the direction of contradictory research. At this point, many scripts die. If our idea does hold up, we continue working on it. This process can take weeks or months. Our Loneliness script, for example,
took over a year and a half to finish. The hardest part is being brief,
while not simplifying too much. It's much easier to
write a long script than a short one. When we're finally done, we do another round of research
and show the script to experts again, ideally different ones than the ones we talked to at the beginning of the process. When we express an opinion, we mark it as such. That's not saying that we don't
draw conclusions from the research. Homeopathy does not work,
and meat is really bad for the planet. Climate change is real, but organic food
is not a good way of solving it. If the facts clearly support a conclusion,
it's OK to present it as such. Of course, we can't always make everybody happy. People who know a lot about a topic sometimes get annoyed if we don't mention an aspect they think is crucial, or when we omit technical terms. This is, more or less, unsolvable
because of the nature of our videos. Scripts have around 1,300 words, so there's always some degree of simplification. You will always find a list of our research and sources and further reading material in the video description. Just citing sources doesn't make your work
accurate or your research good though, so we encourage you to use our sources document as a starting point to look at the topic yourself and learn more. But, it would be dishonest to say 
that we've always worked this way. Some older videos don't live up
to the standards we set ourselves today. The two that annoy us the most
are the Refugee and Addiction videos. In both of them, we didn't try to present a balanced perspective, but instead chose a take and ran with it. The Refugee video was made with a deep feeling
of angry frustration about the world at the high point of the 2015 refugee crisis. While we argued over quotas,
dead children washed ashore on our coastlines. The script was written on one Sunday afternoon, and illustrated and animated within a week. It was exhausting, stressful, and frustrating. We still believe it was the right thing
for European countries to help, but it was absolutely unnecessary
to be toxic about it. We insulted people, and brushed away their concerns
about real and profound challenges. The video was divisive and emotional, at a time when the debate needed a calm and clear overview. The addiction video was based on only one source that has amassed a lot of criticism over the years. And, unfortunately, we did not reach out to scientists, or do extra research, on the papers
that were the basis for the video's thesis. That, addiction is purely psychological and based
on the life circumstances of the individual. This stance is still held by a number of addiction professionals, and we're not saying it's wrong, but a lot of others disagree, and it's not correct to present it as -the- truth. Addiction is far from solved
and our videos should have reflected that, instead of taking one side. We simplified an idea so much, that it made a great story, but became distorting. Both videos were made over the span of two months, and they're two of our most successful videos to date. We had found a formula that really worked. But we never made anything like them again, and have been discussing how to deal
with them for a long time. It doesn't help that both videos are loved by many people. We want to be proud of our work, and these two videos don't make us proud. So, today, we deleted them. It won't purge them from the Internet, but that's not the goal anyway. Feel free to upload them elsewhere. We're working on a new addiction video that we'll take a look
at the chemical and psychological causes. We'll take our sweet time with it,
so please have patience. The refugee video is not up-to-date anymore,
so we will not renew it. We're also going through our older videos to add sources, further reading, and comments in the next few months. Nowadays, rather than trusting in mainstream institutions, we often look at creators on the Internet
for reliable information. We rely on the fact that they're careful and rigorous, and not led by monetary incentives. And we expect them to acknowledge mistakes
in public, and work to minimize them. So, this is what we're going to do: Trust is not a thing you earn once and then keep forever. You have to constantly work for it. So can you trust Kurzgesagt? You can trust that every video we make
is thoroughly researched and approved by different experts. You can trust that we know that we have biases,
and we try to overcome them. We want to move Kurzgesagt further
towards the trustworthy end of the spectrum. The world is too complex for simple answers,
and we don't want to be the ones giving them. Making these videos over the last six years
has been quite a ride, and we're very grateful for it. We hope you'll be with us for the next few years, too. And join us on our journey to figure out
what this universe and life stuff is all about. Thank you for watching."
n3Xv_g3g-mA,2019-02-17T13:29:53.000000,Loneliness,"Everybody feels lonely from time to time When we have no one to sit next to at lunch When we move to a new city or when nobody has time for us at the weekend. But over the last few decad es, this occasional feeling has become chronic for millions. In the UK, 60% of 18 to 34 year old say they often feel lonely. In the US, 46% of the entire population feel lonely regularly. We are living in the most connected time in human history, and yet, an unprecedented number of us feel isolated. Being lonely and being alone are not the same thing. You can be filled by bliss by yourself, and hate every second surrounded by friends. Loneliness is a purely subjective, individual experience. If you feel lonely, you are lonely. A common stereotype is that loneliness only happens to people who don't know how to talk to people, or how to behave around others. But population-based studies have shown that social skills make practically no difference for adults when it comes to social connections. Loneliness can affect everybody. Money, fame, power, beauty, social skills, a great personality— nothing can protect you against loneliness, because it's part of your biology. Loneliness is a bodily function, like hunger. Hunger make you pay attention to your physical needs; loneliness makes you pay attention to your social needs. Your body cares about your social needs, because millions of years ago, it was a great indicator of how likely you were to survive. Natural selection rewarded our ancestors for collaboration, and for forming connections with each other. Our brains grew and became more and more fine-tuned to recognize what others thought and felt, and to form and sustain social bonds. Being social became part of our biology You were born into groups of 50 to 150 people, which you usually stayed with for the rest of your life. Getting enough calories, staying safe and warm, or caring for offspring was practically impossible alone. Being together meant survival, being alone meant death. So it was crucial that you got along with others. For you ancestors, the most dangerous threat to survival was not being eaten by a lion, but not getting the social vibe of your group and being excluded. To avoid that, your body came up with ""social pain"". Pain of this kind is is an evolutionary adaptation to rejection. A sort of early warning system to make sure you stop behaviour that would isolate you. Your ancestors who experienced rejection as more painful were more likely to change their behaviour when they got rejected, and thus stayed in the tribe, while those who did not got kicked out and most likely died. That's why rejections hurt, and even more so, why loneliness is so painful. These mechanisms for keeping us connected worked great for most of our history, until humans began building a new world for themselves The loneliness epidemic we see today really only started in the late Renaissance. Western culture began to focus on the individual. Intellectuals moved away from the collectivism of the Middle Ages, while the young Protestant theology stressed individual responsibility. This trend accelerated during the Industrial Revolution. People left their villages and fields to enter factories. Communities that had existed for hundreds of years began to dissolve, while cities grew. As our world rapidly became modern, this trend sped up more and more. Today, we move vast distances for new jobs, love, and education, and leave our social net behind. We meet fewer people in person, and we meet them less often than in the past. In the US, the mean number of close friends dropped from 3 in 1985 to 2 in 2011. Most people stumble into chronic loneliness by accident. You reach adulthood and become busy with work, university, romance, kids, and Netflix. There's just not enough time. The most convenient and easy thing to sacrifice is time with friends. Until you wake up one day and you realise that you feel isolated, that you yearn for close relationships. But it's hard to find close relationships as adults, and so, loneliness can become chronic. While humans feel pretty great about things like iPhones and spaceships, our bodies and minds are fundamentally the same they were 50,000 years ago We are still biologically fine-tuned to being with each other. large scale studies have shown that the stress that comes from chronic loneliness is among the most unhealthy things we can experience as humans it makes you age quicker it makes cancer deadlier Alzheimer's advance faster your immune systems weaker loneliness is twice as deadly as obesity and as deadly as smoking a pack of ciggarettes a day the most dangerous thing about it is that once it becomes chronic it can become self sustaining physical and social pain use common mechanisms in your brain both feel like a threat and so social pain leads to immediate and defensive behaviour when it's inflicted on you when loneliness becomes chronic your brain goes into self preservation mode it starts to see danger and hostility everywhere but that's not all some studies found that when you're lonely your brain is much more receptive and alert to social signals while at the same time it gets worse at gets worse at interpreting them correctly you pay more attention to others but you understand them less the part of you brain that recognises faces get out of tune and becomes more likely to categorise neutral faces as hostile which makes it distrustful of others loneliness make you assume the worst about others intentions towards you because of this perceived hostile world you can become more self-centred to protect yourself which can make you appear more cold unfriendly and socially awkward than you really are if loneliness has become a strong presence in your life the first thing you can do is to try to recognise vicious cycle you may be trapped in it usually goes something like this an initial feeling of isolation leads to feelings of tension and sadness which makes you focus you attention selectively on negative interactions with others this makes your thoughts about yourself and others more negative which then changes your behaviour you begin to avoid social interaction which leads to more feelings of isolation this cycle becomes more severe and harder to escape each time loneliness make you sit far away from others in class not answer the phone when friends call decline invitations until the invitations stop each and every one of us has a story about ourselves and if your story becomes that people exclude you others pick up on that and so the outside world can become the way you feel about it this is often a slow creeping process that takes years and can end in depression and a mental state that can prevent connections even if you yearn for them the first thing you can do to escape it is to accept that loneliness is a totally normal feeling and nothing to be ashamed of literally everybody feels lonely at some point in their life its a universal human experience you can't eliminate or ignore a feeling until it goes away magically but you can accept that you feel it and get rid of its cause you can self examine what you focus your attention on and check if you are selectively focusing on negative things was this interaction with a colleague rarely negative or was it really mutual or even positive what was the actual content of an interaction? what did the other person say? did they say something bad or did you add extra meaning to their words maybe another person was not really reacting negatively but just short on time then there are your thoughts about the world are you assuming the worst about others intentions do you enter a social situation and have already decided how it will go? do you assume others don't want you around? are you trying to avoid being hurt and not risking opening up and if so can you try to give others the benefit of the doubt can you just assume that they're not against you can you risk being open and vulnerable again? and lastly your behaviour are you avoiding opportunities to be around others are you looking of oppertunites to decline invitations or are you pushing away others preemptively to protect yourself are you acting as if you are getting attacked are you really looking for new connections or have you become complacent with your situation of course every person in each situation is unique and different and just in introspection alone might not be enough LEGAL DISCLAIMER if you feel unable to solve your situation alone by yourself please try to reach out and get professional help its not a sign of weakness but of courage however we look at loneliness as a purely individual problem that needs solving to create happiness or as a public health crisis it is something that deserves more attention humans have build a world that is nothing short of amazing and yet not of the shiny things we have made is able to satisfy or substitute our fundamental and biological need for connection most animals get what they need from their physical sourroundings we get what we need from each other and we need to build our artificial human world based on that (giggling)"
uqKGREZs6-w,2019-02-03T13:29:29.000000,Building a Marsbase is a Horrible Idea: Let’s do it!,"From hostile deserts,
to lonely islands and the highest mountains, wherever there is space
to expand into humans do so. So, it's hardly surprising
that we're already making preparations to set foot on Mars, and to create the first
permanent colony outside of Earth -- maybe even terraform another planet
and turn it into a second blue home. But wait, before we can get to the nice future stuff, we first have to complete
the second phase of colonization; creating a semi-permanent outpost to prepare the ground for a larger human presence. But doing so will be gruesome. Even for an expansionist species like us,
Mars is extreme. At first glance,
Mars seems familiar -- polar ice caps,
large valleys, liquid water under its surface, and a day barely longer than Earth's. The ideal place for us to go. Unfortunately, Mars
is actually a cold, radioactive desert where the ground is poisonous
and breathing is impossible. Mars is awful. You almost certainly don't want to go there. The pioneers doing the hard work on Mars
will have an intensely stressful life, filled with incredibly challenging problems never encountered before. But there are plenty of people
willing to do that work and we have the technology
to enable them to do it. For this video, we will assume
there have been prior missions to Mars to scout out a good place for an outpost, store resources and equipment, and that there's already a moon base that serves as a hub for Mars missions. The first major challenge for our outpost, is the fact that Mars is very energy poor. Because of its distance from the Sun, solar power is only 40% as effective as on Earth. But even this weakened sunlight
is often obscured for days by enormous dust storms. Solar power alone
will probably not be enough. Alternatives, such as wind power,
and geothermal energy are also unfeasible as there's hardly any atmosphere
and Mars' interior is much too cold. Initially, nuclear technology
might be the only option. Since Mars doesn't have
easily accessible radioactive elements, the nuclear fuel needs to come
from Earth along with the reactor. If we do set it up, it could power
our small outpost for the first few years. Unfortunately, all that energy
won't be very useful if we can't breathe. Mars' atmosphere is only 1% as dense as Earth's, and mostly made up of CO2. So, now habitats need to be pressurized
and filled with an artificial atmosphere made of nitrogen and oxygen -- Which comes with more problems. Corners and flat walls are weak points so the habitats will have rounded and smooth shapes to handle the stress of great pressure differences
between the interior and exterior. The airlocks need to be very airtight
and work perfectly every time. Without an extensive magnetosphere, or a dense atmosphere, half of all radiation coming from space reaches the ground. A person on the surface would be subjected
to 50 times the radiation that they would be on Earth. Three years on the surface of Mars
exceeds the radiation dose limits imposed on NASA astronauts for their entire career. This increases cancer risks significantly. To prevent that, we could shield our habitats
with a thick layer of frozen CO2, that can be harvested directly from the atmosphere. Covering the dry ice with a meter of dirt,
would further increase the level of protection. Sadly, this means almost no windows. From the inside,
most living spaces will be windowless tunnels. From the outside,
they'll look like burial mounds. All of this would still not hold back all the radiation, but reduce it just enough
to be survivable for long periods of time. It won't, however, protect anyone who ventures outside. So, remote-controlled robots
will be used for routine work on the surface, while our crew stays inside. Staying inside is a good idea for another reason: Mars dust. It's much finer than dust on Earth, so it could find its way
into the gears or electronics of our machines. Because it's also very dry, it's electro-statically charged; sticking to everything, like spacesuits. It will be impossible to avoid carrying
lots of Mars dust into our habitat, and into the lungs of our crew. To make this even worse, Mars' soil
is filled with very toxic perchlorate salts. Constant exposure could be deadly. This problem can still be overcome though. Space suits, for example, could be made in a way
that they never truly enter the base, but stay attached to the outside of the habitats. Okay, great. Now we've safely isolated humans in terms of energy and air, and protected them from cancer,
we just need to feed them. Water is easy to come by if a settlement
is positioned near the Martian poles with their thick layers of ice. Growing food is a different kind of challenge though. Mars' soils are alkaline and lack the vital nitrogen compounds
that plants need to grow. Before we can grow anything,
we will have to decontaminate the soil which is difficult and expensive. Then, the soil can be fertilized using recycled biological waste. All of this will take a lot of time,
and is very energy-intensive. So, we might use aquaponics
to raise fish and plants together -- Making the astronauts' diets
more varied and tasty at the same time. This will be an important
psychological boost for our overworked crew. All of these things don't solve one fundamental problem though: Mars has only 38 percent of Earth's surface gravity, which could cause muscle-wasting,
bone loss, and cardiovascular problems. While this might be solved in the future
by setting up rotating living spaces, for now, our crew has to live with low gravity and exercise a lot to slow the degradation down. The crews will probably have to rotate every few years, after being stuck indoors
in tight spaces without windows. With the same people,
performing the same routines day-in day-out with little contact from the outside world, and a lot to worry about. Like Antarctic scientists or submarine staff, they will undergo intense psychological screening to make sure they're mentally resilient enough
to handle this lifestyle for several years. Establishing the first real infrastructure
on Mars will be extremely taxing work that only a group of very determined,
and competent, people can do. Luckily, we have enough of these on Earth. And there you have it! A small Mars base that will survive
for at least a few decades -- as long as it's getting a constant supply of resources, parts, nuclear fuel, and crews from Earth. Unfortunately, Mars and Earth
are separated by millions of kilometers and orbital periods that leave
only a narrow travel window every two years. If there's an emergency in the colony, Earth wouldn't be able to help
until the next travel window opens. Helpers may arrive on a planet
filled with corpses. Settling Mars will be the toughest challenge we have ever faced. It will be gruesome work to establish
the infrastructure we need. But we're stubborn,
and we like extreme challenges. If we push through Phase Two of colonization,
anything is possible. Cities illuminating the dark Martian night, a hub for travel between the planets, industries setting foot in orbit terraforming a true multi-planetary future. Going to Mars is hard but worth it. And if we're lucky, we might be around
long enough to see it happening and cheer on the people who take on these challenges for the benefit of us all."
8PmM6SUn7Es,2019-01-13T13:30:01.000000,Is Organic Really Better? Healthy Food or Trendy Scam?,"Over the last few years, organic food has spread like wildfire. Despite higher prices, buying organic is turning from an alternative into a moral and social responsibility. Organic food is supposedly healthier more natural and more ethical. But what do we even mean when we say organic? There's no global consensus, so different regions have different definitions and rules. In general, organic food is farmed without GMO seeds, synthetic fertilizers, or synthetic pesticides. Instead, organic farmers use more traditional ways of producing food, like crop rotation, and use organic fertilizers such as compost or manure. While the motivation to buy organic food is clearly noble, is it actually effective or just another costly trend we can skip without feeling guilty? [Music] Is organic food healthier? One idea associated with organic crops is that their natural cultivation is supposed to make them more nutritious and healthier. Indeed, several studies found that organic foods contain more antioxidants. Plants produce them as a sort of homemade pesticide. Organic plants seem to have to work a little harder, while regular plants have plenty of help from humans. Antioxidants are believed to have some health benefits, although scientists are still on the fence about them in general. We have no idea if and how exactly they help us, or how much produce you'd have to eat to absorb a certain amount. What about organic being more nutritious? Well, the evidence is mixed. Some studies found that organic food can have slightly higher concentrations of vitamin C, and omega-3 fatty acids, while others did not find significant differences. Overall, the mixed evidence suggests that there are only small differences in nutritional value. So, from the science available so far, it doesn't look like organic food has significant health benefits. What we do know, is that eating fruit and veggies in general is good for you, and most of us don't do that enough. Eating veggies is more important for your health than how they were produced. Is organic food more natural? People don't only buy organic to get extra vitamins, but to avoid something toxic; artificial pesticides and fertilizers. And indeed several studies show that there actually is less pesticide residue on organic produce. But here's where things get complicated. Less pesticide does not mean none at all. While pesticides are supposed to be a last resort in organic farming, they're not forbidden. Most organic pesticides are natural toxins, like vegetable oils, hot ash soap, sulfur or copper sulfates. But there are synthetic substances as well. What's the difference between organic and regular pesticides? Not a lot actually. Organic pesticides are not necessarily safer than conventional ones. Toxic is toxic. No matter if the substance is manufactured, or derived from nature. In fact, in the case of copper sulfate, often used on organic apples, the organic pesticide of choice is actually more harmful to humans. The toxicity of any substance depends on its concentration and your exposure to it -- not if it's natural or not. There are a few recent studies about how our current level of pesticide exposure affects our long-term health. The 2018 study from France associated never eating organic food with a higher risk of certain cancers. The study was criticized a lot though. The participants reported their dietary habits themselves, while no actual tests of pesticide levels in their bodies were done. Complicating things even more, a Danish study from 2018 found that the danger from pesticides for an adult was similar to drinking a glass of wine every three months. The pesticides on your vegetables are nothing to lose sleep over. Despite this, we should continue to demand strict standards for our food. All pesticides are regulated and tested very strictly in the EU and the US. Every year, thousands of food samples are screened for pesticides. The majority of samples have no residues or just a fraction of the tolerance level. Right now, contamination from bacteria and fungi is much more dangerous. And, on this front, the risk is the same -- be it organic or regular food. Is organic food better for the environment? In 2017, a meta-analysis looked at organic farming in detail and analyzed organic and regular foods from over 700 production sources, and their impact on categories like greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and land needs. The result? No production method is clearly better for the environment. Organic systems use less energy than conventional ones, but have similar greenhouse gas emissions. Organic farms use less pesticide, but need much more land to produce the same amount of crop. These mixed results were also confirmed by a report from the Swedish food agency. Organic and regular were equal in most regards. The biggest difference was land use. And here conventional farming clearly won, and ecotoxicity where organic farming has a clear advantage. So, according to these results, conventional farming actually has a little bit less impact on the environment compared to organic. The bottom line is organic food isn't superior to regular produce as far as we know. But, organic agriculture also has an impact at a broader level. Demand is rising constantly, and the struggle to supply the market can lead to production methods that are less sustainable in other ways. Spain, for example, grows tons of regular and organic vegetables destined for export in vast greenhouse areas which use a lot of energy. And have other environmental impacts, such as significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions. And, because growing demand can't be covered by domestic production, the global trade and organic foods is also increasing. As supply chains get more and more complex, to make all kinds of foods available in organic quality, ensuring organic quality standards and regulations gets ever more difficult. This has led to incidences of fraud where conventional food was labeled and sold as expensive organic produce. But, organic versus conventional food isn't even an objective discussion. Organic is not simply a production method. For many, it's an ideology. Buying organic feels right. People want to do the correct thing for the health of their children, and the well-being of the planet. But, our instinct to think of organic as good, and conventional as bad, can get in the way of making the most reasonable decision. The solution could be to stop seeing organic and conventional farming as irreconcilable. They both have pros and cons, and the best way to produce healthy food efficiently would be a combination of their best features. And, as for your personal shopping, what food you should buy depends on what you expect from it. If you simply want to eat healthily, you should buy more fruit and vegies of any kind, not necessarily organic. If your concern is for the environment, then simply buying organic won't solve this problem for you. The easiest option, is to buy local food that's in season. Basically, seasonal is the true organic. To sum up, an organic label is a manufacturing notice, not a security certificate or a silver bullet for your diet. What you eat is much more important than how its produced."
M7CkdB5z9PY,2018-12-27T13:30:00.000000,Aliens under the Ice – Life on Rogue Planets,"Rogue planets are planets that travel through the universe alone. They inhabit the dark and vast space between the stars. Drifting alone through eternal darkness, no light warms their surfaces, and they're exposed to the freezing cold of outer space. They know no seasons, no days, and no nights,
which could give away the passing of time. And yet, rogue planets might carry alien life to all corners of the galaxy. How would that work? And how does a planet become a rogue anyway? [Music] There are several very different things that get called rogue planets. For example, sub-brown dwarfs
-- gas giants that form from collapsing gas clouds and are the boring little brothers of brown dwarfs. They're a sort of failed star, and we'll now stop talking about them. A far more interesting sort of rogue,
are terrestrial planets, similar to Earth, that got kicked out of their planetary system. Young star systems are dangerous places, where protoplanets are battling for the available mass, guzzling up as much material as possible. In this fight for dominance, they collide with each other, or get dangerously close to each other's orbits. If a very massive planet moves its orbit closer to the star, it can kick smaller planets out of the system. But just because a planet has survived the growing pains of formation, doesn't mean it's safe. Planetary systems can be disrupted by flybys from stars, or black holes, at any point. Up to half of all planets born could end up as rogues. Scientists don't agree on the numbers, but it's likely that, at the very least, there are billions of rogue planets in the Milky Way alone. Most rogues will share the same depressing fate, as their star becomes smaller, day by day, the planet's surface quickly cools down to minus 270 degrees Celsius. If they have oceans, they'll freeze and become as hard as bedrock. Their atmospheres will sink down to the surface
and eventually freeze, too. But, weirdly enough, some of these frozen, dark deserts could harbor life. To understand how, let's imagine a planet similar to Earth, in the same order of magnitude in terms of mass and composition. If we put it into deep space, how could it still support life? As far as we understand the nature of life, there is one indispensable ingredient it needs: liquid water. Water is important because it mixes things, both matter and energy, which lets interesting chemistry happen, like life. So our planet needs enough energy to keep at least a part of our oceans warm enough to sustain liquid water. Annoyingly, about 99.97% of Earth's energy budget comes from the Sun. So our imaginary rogue earth needs to work with the 0.03 percent of energy it has left, which almost exclusively comes from its hot center. Earth's inner core is a giant metal ball, about as hot as the surface of the Sun, that's surrounded by the outer core made up of liquid metals that are very, very slowly solidifying releasing a lot of heat in the process. As long as this process is ongoing, our planet will be geologically active with solid and liquid material moving around and transporting energy to the surface where it can be harnessed as geothermal energy. While the hot core of every planet will cool off eventually, this process takes billions of years. Enough time for life to come into existence and thrive. There's even one scenario that could allow an Earth-like planet to have oceans that are not frozen over. If the planet had an extremely dense
and high-pressure hydrogen atmosphere, the gas would not freeze and could trap enough of the heat trying to escape the planet to enable oceans that extend all the way to the surface. And there's another possible way to stay warm: moons. If a rogue planet brings a moon or more along with them, a large enough moon could inject additional energy into the system via tidal forces. These forces stretch and squeeze the planet a little bit every day, like kneading dough, keeping it warm. But the most likely scenario for a rogue bearing life is one with sub-glacial oceans  under a kilometer thick layer of mostly water ice. These are not completely absurd,
since we already have a few of them in the Solar System. So how could life sustain itself
at the bottom of a completely dark, cold ocean. On Earth, deep down in our oceans in complete darkness, in volcanically-active areas, there are hydrothermal vents called black smokers. They spew out a cloud of black material and hot water providing a constant flow of minerals from Earth's mantle. Bacteria feed on the minerals and produce organic materials, which attracts crustaceans, bivalves, snails, fish, octopus, and tube worms up to 2 meters long. Not only are hydrothermal vents home
to an incredibly diverse group of living beings, but also a contender for the place
where life could have begun on Earth billions of years ago. In the dark ocean of a rogue planet,
similar events or volcanic activity, could be the starting point and basis for complex ecosystems we can only imagine right now. One upside an ecosystem in a rogue planet ocean has, is that the environment is extremely stable. The thick ice sheet protects it
from all sorts of extinction events, and, as long as the energy from the core keeps on coming, things stay pretty much the same. The most likely forms of life
are bacteria and other microorganisms. But, given enough time, more complex alien animals could feed
on the smaller beings and thrive. It's not impossible that intelligent life
could emerge in such an environment. If it did, it would find itself in a pretty weird world. Constricted by an impassable wall of rock-hard ice at the top, and bedrock at the bottom. Without any plants to store star energy, there would be no wood, oil, or coal. Even if there were,
it's not like you'd discover fire at the bottom of an ocean. Without this energy, metals may never be forged into useful things. Our intelligent alien friends might never break through the ice. They might never realize that there is such a thing as outside, and assumed that their small world is all there is. Millions of generations might live and die in these dark oceans, ignorant of the unbelievably big universe above the ice. Until the core of their planet cools off, and all life vanishes. As the oceans completely freeze, the remnants of cultures and ecosystems will be trapped in an icy grave forever. If you think about it,
it might be better not to be aware of all that. But the concept is disturbing and exciting. The universe might be teeming with life, trapped on planets that are basically impossible to leave. Worlds like this could frequently pass the Solar System,
without us even knowing. Maybe one day, in the far future, humans will set foot on one of these frozen worlds and try to say ""hello."""
pP44EPBMb8A,2018-12-20T13:30:22.000000,How to Build a Dyson Sphere - The Ultimate Megastructure,"Human history is told by the energy we use. At first we had to use our muscles, then we learned to control fire. We industrialized the world using coal and oil and entered the Atomic Age when we learned how to split a nucleus. At each step, we increased our energy harvest to a scale never seen before and advanced as a species. Currently, we're slowly transitioning to renewables and if we're lucky, fusion energy will become viable in the future. As humanity progresses further, if we don't destroy ourselves or our habitat, we will likely gain complete control of our planet's resources. At that stage we'll probably begin to look outwards for new places to expand into. But space is hard and establishing a serious human presence in the solar system will require ungodly amounts of energy. Luckily, we know where to find it. The Sun - the ultimate source of energy. A furnace 100 quintillion times more powerful than our most efficient nuclear reactor. It shines with the energy of a trillion nuclear bombs per second. So, how do we get this energy? Not some of it, all of it. If we want to collect the most energy physically possible, we'll have to build the largest most ambitious structure in the universe. The Dyson Sphere, a megastructure that encompasses a whole star to capture its power output. For an intelligent species, building a Dyson Sphere is a technological leap on a par with the discovery of fire for our ancestors. The transition from a planetary species to an interstellar species. It would usher in an age of exploration and expansion on a scale we can barely imagine. So, what would it look like? Solid shell enveloping the Sun is probably not the way to go a large rigid body like that would be vulnerable to impacts possibly shattering it would be liable to drift and could crash straight into the Sun a More, viable design for a Dyson Sphere might be a Dyson swarm an enormous set of orbiting panels that collect the sun's power and beam it elsewhere such as sward would give humanity basically unlimited energy but building it won't be easy the Sun is very big so we need a lot of satellites if Each satellite is a square kilometer we'd need around 30 quadrillion to surround the Sun even if they're built as lightly as possible we need about 100 quintillion tons of material and Then we need the energy to actually put the parts together and deliver them to their positions around the Sun on top of all that we need to have a permanent infrastructure set up in space to start building let's assume for the purposes of this video that our descendants will take care of that and want to create the mega structure We can sort the challenges into three main categories materials design and energy To get the vast amounts of raw materials required for our Dyson swarm will have to largely disassemble a whole planet Of the planets available mercury is the best candidate it's the closest to the Sun and very metal-rich close to the Sun also Means less moving stuff around and mercury has no atmosphere and only about a third of the surface gravity of Earth making it comparatively easy to launch material into space Next we should consider the design of our swarm simpler is better Conventional solar panels are far too intricate and short lives our satellites need to operate without repairs or intervention for astronomically long times and they need to be cheap to produce But they're most likely going to be enormous mirrors which refocus sunlight to central collecting stations like in concentrated solar power on earth to build and launch them efficiently they must be incredibly light made of little more than polished metal full bound to some supports and Last we need the energy to build and launch the swarm itself taking a part of planets and launching things into space requires an enormous amount of energy for example if we used all the fossil fuels and Uranium on earth and we? Were perfectly efficient we could only launch as much Mass as Mount Everest into space a rather meager accomplishment compared to planetary disassembly To get the energy needed to build a Dyson Sphere it's almost as if you're going to need the power output of a dyson sphere But that's. Ok there's plenty of sunlight to be had on Mercury so let's get to work Humans are expensive to keep alive and are very sensitive to the environment So, we'd want to automate as much as possible Ideally we'd have a small crew of controllers who oversee an army of autonomous machines doing the actual work There are four major pieces of technology required solar collectors miners refiners and launch equipment the solar collectors are going to give us the energy we need to disassemble the planet To start maybe we deploy something like one square kilometer of them either as mirrors or as traditional solar panels they'll provide the energy to run our miners which strip-mine the surface of the planet and our refiners which extract valuable elements and fabricate them into our swarm satellites to get them into space we need a creative and efficient solution Rockets aren't too expensive and difficult to deorbit and reuse Instead, we'll want to use a sort of railgun a longer Electromagnetic track which launches our satellites at high speeds Our swarm satellites will be packed tight for launch unfurling like an enormous origami once in orbit from this point we can take advantage of exponential growth using the energy of the existing parts of the swarm to build more infrastructure on Mercury and launch new panels faster and faster each panel provides the energy to build another those to work together to build the next to Four become eight eight become 16 and so on within just about 60 doubling times the Sun would be completely surrounded by solar panels and This can happen quickly if a square kilometer of solar collectors takes a month to build we could be done in a decade if only our infrastructure on the planet's surface can keep up with the quickly growing budget of energy Even collecting 1% of the sun's energy is an unbelievable change in our species energy budget We could create the infrastructure to being basically unlimited amounts of energy around the solar system for all sorts of projects colonies on other worlds terraforming planets constructing more mega structures or even traveling to other stars it could be the start of an interstellar Civilization based on physics alone this is not just possible but easy It's such a simple process and such a necessary step for any species to expand beyond their home planet that many astronomers Think there are probably Dyson spheres already out there in the Milky Way we haven't spotted any yet but they could be there it's far from certain that humanity will ever get to this point our attention is too often focused on short-term political gains and Conflicts that will not matter in the long run but if we survive the challenges we've set ourselves we could potentially become the first species in the universe to create a structure with the scope of a star if We? Do it the only limitation left will be our own imagination"
yS1ibDImAYU,2018-11-25T13:30:02.000000,End of Space – Creating a Prison for Humanity,"Space travel is the most exciting and challenging adventure humanity has ever undertaken. But in an irony 
of history, we may stop ourselves from going 
into space the more we do it. With every 
rocket launched and with every 
satellite deployed, we're creating a trap for ourselves that gets 
deadlier and more dangerous every year. If it's ever activated, it could end the Space Age and trap us 
on our planet for decades, or even centuries. Getting something into space 
is incredibly hard. To do so, you need 
to move very, very fast. At first, straight up
to leave the atmosphere, then sideways to begin 
a sort of circling around the Earth, still, very, very fast. If you do that successfully 
you can enter a Low Earth orbit. And once in orbit, it's very hard 
to get out of orbit. Unless you have 
energy to spare, you're sort of locked in here, 
falling around the Earth forever. That's great for things 
we want to stay up, like space stations 
and satellites. And so we moved the majority of humanity's 
space infrastructure to this place, just a few hundred kilometers 
above the surface. Just high enough so that the atmosphere 
is so thin, that orbiting things 
can stay up for centuries before air resistance can slow them 
enough to bring them back to Earth. But this is also the source 
of our deadly trap. Rockets are really metal cylinders 
that keep big parts of fuel in place. Whenever a portion 
of the fuel has been spent, the empty tanks are dropped 
to make the rocket lighter. Some parts 
crash down to earth or burn up 
in the atmosphere. But most of the useless 
rocket parts stay up and begin 
to orbit the planet. After decades 
of space travel low Earth orbit is a junkyard of spent boosters, broken satellites and millions 
of pieces of shrapnel from missile tests 
and explosions. Right now we know of around 
2,600 defunct satellites, 10,000 objects bigger 
than a monitor, 20,000 as large 
as an apple, 500,000 pieces 
the size of a marble and at least 100 million parts 
so small they can't be tracked. This debris is moving 
at speeds of up to 30,000 km/h, circling Earth on criss-
crossing orbits multiple times a day. Orbital speeds are so fast 
that being hit by debris the size of a pea is like 
being shot by a plasma gun. On impact the debris vaporises, releasing enough energy 
to punch holes straight through solid metal. So, we've covered the space around our planet with millions of deadly pieces of destruction, and we also put a trillion dollar 
global infrastructure network right in the danger zone. It performs critical duties 
essential to the modern world: global communication, GPS 
and navigation, collecting weather data, looking out 
for asteroids and all manner 
of scientific discoveries: things we would miss very much 
if they suddenly went away. If just one pea-sized bullet 
hits one of our 1,100 working satellites, 
it will be destroyed instantly. Three or four satellites are already 
being destroyed this way every year. As the number of satellites and the amount of junk in orbit is expected to grow tenfold in the next decade, we're approaching 
a tipping point. But the worst thing in space 
is not tiny pieces of junk. The worst thing would be 
an unstoppable chain reaction that turns a lot of non junk things 
into junk. For example: if two satellites hit each other 
in just the right way. If satellites collide they don't stop 
and fall out of the sky. It's more of a splash 
than a crash. Orbital speeds 
are so fast solid pieces spray 
right through each other, transforming the two satellites 
into clouds of thousands of little things still fast enough 
to destroy more satellites. This could trigger the slowest 
and most destructive sort of domino effect: a collision cascade. Like a shotgun spray, each collision 
creates more bullets. What was once 
a single tiny target very unlikely to hit anything becomes 
a wall of destruction hungry 
to make more. As more and more satellites 
are destroyed the destruction 
accelerates exponentially, eventually destroying 
everything parked in orbit. But space 
is very empty, so the first few collisions 
may take a long time. By the time we realize 
what's happening, it's too late. One year one satellite 
is destroyed and that's 
no big deal. The next year, five. The year after, 50. Until there's nothing left. The situation in orbit 
is rapidly worsening and we may already 
be past the point of no return. Within 10 years space around Earth may no longer 
be viable for long term satellites or rockets. The worst case scenario 
is horrifying. A debris field made of hundreds 
of millions of pieces, many too small to track,
moving at 30,000 km/h. It would effectively create 
a deadly barrier around Earth, possibly too dangerous 
to cross. Dreams 
of moon bases, Mars colonies 
or space travel at all may be 
set back centuries. And the loss 
of our space infrastructure would send some of the technology 
we rely on daily back to the 1970s. But it might not be too late 
to clean up our mess. While the space industry has become 
better at avoiding space junk, it's still growing fast and occasional 
weapon tests don't help. So there have been a couple of wild 
but also serious suggestions. About how to quickly remove 
as much deadly space junk as possible without creating more 
in the process. Lots of ideas 
are being thrown around, and some 
of the most seriously considered involve capture 
and return missions, which are 
being tested now. One method involves meeting a piece of junk
in orbit with a small satellite and loaded with a net. Once caught, a small rocket could be used 
to bring it down towards Earth. Targets too large for a net might be instead caught 
with a harpoon on a tether. Instead of firing 
a rocket the cleaner would deploy a large sail 
to produce atmospheric drag and accelerate
orbital decay. And there are lots of other wild sci-fi 
sounding proposals too. Some might use 
giant electromagnets. These magnetic tugs work by pushing on 
the magnetic components inside satellites that they use 
to stabilize and orientate themselves 
in Earth's magnetic field. These may be safer and more reliable 
than nets and harpoons because they never have to make contact 
with the junk they're handling, so there's no risk of accidentally breaking up 
their target into more junk. As for the tiniest bits of junk, lasers might be the key 
to vaporising them entirely. Satellites with lasers wouldn't 
need to visit their targets. They can shoot them 
from far away. Large objects 
can't exactly be shot down, but lasers 
can be used to ablate them, or burn tiny amounts 
of material off the side to push the junk 
to a safer orbit. Whatever technology we use at the end,
we better start doing something soon, before 100 million bullets become 
a trillion and the trap is set. If we don't act, our adventure 
in space might end before 
it's even begun."

Or simply the reflection of the sun on an empty bottle. Beauty is nothing tangible, it only exists in our heads as a pleasant feeling. If we have to define it, we perceive something as beautiful if its color, shape, form, or proportion somehow are appealing or delightful to us. Beauty is a very human experience that's been with us for millions of years. Even our first tools were trimmed to a symmetrical shape. Researchers have tried to find practical reasons why our ancestors invested the time to make their tools look nice, but couldn't really identify any. It seems that early humans shaped their tools into teardrops, simply because they liked them better that way. Throughout our history, the definition of beauty has changed a lot. Ideals have shifted or turned into their opposites. But beyond individual and contemporary tastes some things have never really gone out of fashion. The golden ratio, symmetry, or fractal patterns can be found in the art and architecture of cultures from our beginnings, to today. Humans seem to be in mysterious, inherent agreement about the beauty of certain things. The patterns that keep coming up are all rooted in nature. They became part of our biology because they helped our ancestors survive. Fractal patterns for example, occur all over nature. In snail shells, flower heads; waves or clouds Identifying and assessing these things and phenomena correctly used to be vital. Do those clouds mean rain will come soon? Are these waters safe to swim through? Can I eat this? Another pervasive thing is symmetry. In nature it means everything is as it should be Stems and trees and leaves and blossoms all grow symmetrically A deer with impressive antlers is probably a source of nutritious meat. A deformed wheat hair may not be safe to eat. A symmetrical face is more likely to belong to a healthy and fertile mating partner. Because symmetry is so common in fauna and flora, it's extremely familiar to our brain. It helped our ancestors evaluate their environment more easily, and react quickly to danger. Things that helped us survive activate the reward center in our brain. recognising signals of safety and nutrition, triggered nice feelings in us. So our sense of beauty probably evolved from pattern recognition, but it goes way beyond that now. Humans seem to have evolved an instinct for beauty that is deeply hardwired into us. It remain even after other processes in our brain stop working. Alzheimer's patients were asked to rank the beauty of several paintings Then the experiment was repeated two weeks later The patients have long since forgotten the paintings, but still ranked the beauty of the paintings in the same order. One could argue that this doesn't say much. So what if people stick to their personal preferences? But other research has shown that we have a sort of lowest common denominator when it comes to beauty. In different experiments, people were asked to distinguish real from fake abstract paintings. Some were originals by Mondrian and Pollock that were painted based on strict rules like fractal patterns, while the imitations were not. The majority picked out the original artworks. This worked for paintings from both artists, even though their arts are very different. Another experiment also used abstract artworks but, asked people to pick them out among similar paintings made either by children or animals. Again, the test subjects pointed out the legit paintings whose patterns were carefully planned and not random So while we have a hard time pinning down what beauty is or what it's based on, we somehow recognize it when we see it Humans don't navigate nature trying to survive day by day anymore We left the natural world behind and created our own. We made the objects that surround us the things we wear and use and look at. As we spread over the planet and our numbers grew, we shaped a completely man-made environment. In the process of doing so, we often neglected beauty in favor of functionality cost or efficiency. We built rows and rows of concrete housing blocks that nobody wants to live in. We have ugly underground subway stations, shabby public service buildings, and sprawling malls. One bland, standardized box beside the next. Humans, don't like monotony. Eye tracking software has shown that people keep focusing on details and ornaments of architecture while brushing quickly over blank walls And not only are they no fun to look at, they actually make us miserable. Experiments with skin sensors showed that looking at vast, dull facades makes us feel bored and uncomfortable. This kind of boredom has been linked to raised heart rates and stress levels and the opposite seems to be true, too. Over the last decades more and more studies have found that surroundings that are actually aesthetically pleasing to us can improve our well-being, our behavior, cognitive function, and mood. Our bodies and brains react measurably and visibly to everything that surrounds us Beauty in particular has such a strong impact on our well-being that making useful things beautiful can actually make them better. In 2017, a hospital examined recovery factors through observation and interviews with patients and found that visual art in their lounge areas made them more comfortable and happier about their stay in general. Another study looked at how well patients recovered in a hospital that had two wards. A very old and rather ugly one, and a newly renovated ward. To the researchers' surprise, the patients that stayed in the new, renovated environment, needed less pain medication and were released on average, two days earlier than patients recovering in the old ward. More beautiful surroundings made them feel better, physically. Beauty also has an effect on us on a daily basis. It can improve our general happiness. A study that looked at the main factors influencing the happiness of adults revealed an unexpected result. Besides things like good health in a harmonious family life, individual happiness is affected by how beautiful you find the city you live in. Beauty scored even higher than cleanliness or safety. So what can we learn from all of this? We know that we humans have been fine-tuned for millions of years to process visual input and assess our surroundings. It's just what we're programmed to do and we're starting to learn more about how much beauty as a property is really influencing us. Beauty meets an inherent need for meaningful information. Maybe it would be worth giving it more space in this man-made world we have created. This video was a collaboration with the creative agencies, Sagmeister and Walsh as a contribution to their upcoming beauty exhibition. The exhibition will be shown at the Mak Vienna from Oct. 23, 2018 - Mar. 31, 2019 and a Mak Frankfurt from May 01, 2019 - Sept. 30, 2019 If you want to learn more about the impact of beauty and see tons of gorgeous installations and multimedia objects, go check it out! review: Doğa Poyraz Tahan"
NxvQPzrg2Wg,2018-09-30T13:03:53.000000,Why Meat is the Best Worst Thing in the World 🍔,"Humans love meat. Steak, fried chicken, bacon, pork belly, and sausages
are just the best things! Eating meat has become so
trivial that many people don't consider something a proper
meal if there's no animal involved. Which is pretty amazing, since only a few decades ago
meat was a luxury product. Today, you can get a cheeseburger
for a dollar. Paradoxically, meat is pretty much the
most inefficient way of feeding humans. If we look at it on a global scale, our meaty diet
is literally eating up the planet. Why is that, and what can we do about it,
without giving up steak? ♪ Catchy intro tune ♪ Humans keep a lot of animals
for food: Currently about 23 billion chickens, 1.5 billion cattle, and roughly 1 billion pigs and sheep. That's a lot of mouths to feed, so we've transformed earth into a giant feeding ground. 83% of its farmland is used for livestock. For example as pasture, and to farm fodder crops;
like corn and soy. That's 26% of earth's total land area. If we include the water we need
for these plants, meat and dairy production accounts
for 27% of global freshwater consumption. Unfortunately; meat production is like
a black hole for resources. Since animals are living things, most of their food
is used to keep them alive, while they grow their tasty parts. Only a fraction of the nutrients from fodder crops end up in the meat we buy in the end. Cows, for example,
convert only about 4% of the proteins and 3% of the calories of the plants we feed to them
into beef. More than 97% of the calories are lost to us. To create one kilogram of steak, a cow needs to eat up to 25 kilos of grain and uses up to 15,000 liters of water. Animal products are guzzling up tons of food, but they only make up 18% of the calories humans eat. According to projections, we could nourish 
an additional 3.5 billion people if we just ate the stuff we feed to animals. To make our favorite food group
even more unsustainable, about 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions
caused by humans, are created by the meat industry; as much as by all ships, planes,
trucks and cars combined. And... there's another aspect to meat: It comes from actual living beings. Pigs, cattle and chicken are not the ones
writing the history books, but if they were, humans would appear
as rampant genocidal maniacs, that thrive on suffering. Globally, we kill about 200 million animals every day, about 74 billion a year. This means that every one and a half years, we kill more animals than people have lived
in the entire 200,000 year history of humanity. One could argue that we're doing them
a favor: after all,
they wouldn't exist without us. We might eat them in the end, but we also provide food and shelter, and the gift of existence to them. Unfortunately, we're not very nice gods. A lot of our meat comes from factory farms: huge industrial systems
that house thousands of animals. Engineered to be as efficient as possible, they have little regard for things like quality of life. Most pigs are raised in gigantic windowless sheds, and never get to see the sun. Sows are kept in pens too small to turn around, where they give birth to one litter of piglets after another, until it's their turn to be turned into bacon. Dairy cows are forced to breed continually 
to ensure their milk supply, but are separated from their calves
hours after birth. To fatten up beef cattle for slaughter,
they're put in feedlots: Confined pens where they can't roam
and put on weight more quickly. To make it possible to keep them so tightly together
without dying of diseases, the majority of antibiotics we use are for livestock: up to 80% in the US. Which helps in the short term,
but also fuels antibiotic resistances. But the ones that may have got the worst deal
are chickens. In factory farms, they're kept in such vast numbers and so close to each other, that they can't form the social structures they have in nature, so they start attacking each other. To stop that we cut their beaks and claws. Male chickens are deemed worthless: since they can't lay eggs and are not suitable
for meat production. So within minutes after birth,
they're usually gassed and shredded in grinders. Several hundred million baby chickens
are killed this way each year. Even if you had a personal score to settle with chickens, how we treat them is beyond broken. So, better buy organic meat
where animals are treated nicely, right? Organic farming regulations are designed to grant animals a minimum of comfort. The problem is that ""organic"" is an elastic term. According to EU regulations, an organic hen still might share
one square metre of space with five others. That's a long way off from happy farmyard chickens. Farms that sincerely do their best
do exist of course, but meat is still a business. An organic label is a way
to charge more money, and countless scandals
have revealed producers looking for ways
to cheat the system. And while organic meat might be less cruel, it needs even more resources
than conventional meat production. So, buying organic is still preferable, but does not grant you moral absolution. The truth is,
if suffering were a resource: we would create billions of tons
of it per year. The way we treat animals will probably be one of the things future generations will look down on in disgust. While all these things are true,
something else is true too: Steak is amazing; Burgers are the best food; Chicken wings taste great. Meat satisfies something
buried deep in our lizard brain. We hardly ever see
how our meat is made: we just eat it and love it. It creates joy, it brings us together for family meals
and barbecue parties. Eating meat doesn't make you
a bad person. Not eating meat doesn't make you
a good one. Life is complicated
and so is the world we've created. So, how should we deal with the fact
that meat is extremely unsustainable, and a sort of horrible torture? For now, the easiest option is opting out more often. Taking a meat-free day per week
already makes a difference. If you want to eat meat produced
with less suffering: try to buy from trusted producers
with a good track record, even if it costs more. To make an impact on the environment: go for chicken and pig,
rather than lamb and beef, as they convert their feed
more efficiently into meat. And if you're going to have your steak:
you should eat it too! An average American throws out
nearly a pound of food per day, a lot of which is meat. In the future, science could get us clean meat. Various startups have successfully
grown meat in labs, and are working on doing so
on a commercial scale. But solutions like this
are still a few years away. For now, enjoy your steak, but also respect it. And if you can: make it something special again."
NtQkz0aRDe8,2018-09-16T12:27:14.000000,How We Could Build a Moon Base TODAY – Space Colonization 1,"Humans dream about leaving Earth
and traveling through the galaxy. But we were born too early to be part of it. Or were we? The reality is, we could begin our dream
by building a Moon base today. We actually do have the technology and current estimates from NASA
and the private sector say it could be done for 20 to 40 billion dollars,
spread out over about a decade. The price is comparable to
the International Space Station or the budget surplus of Germany in 2017. Not that big an investment really. The payoff would be immeasurable. The Moon is a sandbox to develop new technologies and exploit unlimited resources. It would start a new space race and lay the foundation for us to spread out
into the solar system and beyond. It would create a vast array of new
technologies to benefit us on Earth and we would all be part of it. So, why aren't we doing it? Well, sadly, it's hard to get governments interested in long-term investments in the future of humanity. Let's imagine, just doing it. If we start today, how would we build a Moon base? (Kurzgesagt intro music) Kurzgesagt in collaboration with BRILLIANT Throughout history, colonization happened in phases: In the first phase of the age of exploration
of the new world, for example, European monarchs funded expeditions to chart
and discover and to stake their claims. They planted a flag and set up a camp,
but they didn't stay. In the second phase, small missions set up outposts and settlements were founded, which was still very dependent on
their home countries for supplies. Some failed, but others survived and
established a permanent presence. Only then, in the third phase, did a true colony form to which tradesmen and laborers could emigrate, creating new wealth and opportunities
for themselves and their families, sending extreme wealth back
to their countries of origin. When we colonize the Moon, we'll go through the same three phases. This time, without murdering millions
of innocent people in the process. The Moon is not a welcoming place for living things. A Moon day lasts 29 Earth days, with a difference of maybe 300 degrees
Celsius between sunlight and shade. There's no atmosphere to shield us from meteorites,
big and small, or cosmic radiation. Worse still, the lunar surface is covered
in a layer of nasty jagged dust. The Moon is hard. But we're good at doing hard things. In the first phase of lunar colonization, our explorers proved it can be done that a new world can be reached. This phase started 60 years ago with the Apollo missions. Since then, satellites like the American Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter have mapped the Moon, while rovers like the Chinese Yutu (玉兔), have studied the composition of the lunar surface, Looking for water, ice, and metals. Phase one is more or less complete. We know what we need to know to enter phase two. In the second phase, astronauts will build the first Moonbase and this could begin today. The first small Moonbase could
be completed in a decade. The first nation that establishes this base, will be akin to the first nations building outposts in the new world 500 years ago. It's expensive to send rockets to the Moon. So we will send as little as possible. The base will be light, little more than inflatable habitats for crews of no more than 12, and will be deployed somewhere with natural shelter. Options include caves, like underground lava tube tunnels, or craters near the poles, where the days are six months long. These astronauts will not stay long. The habitat is likely to be abandoned between missions, as solar panels cannot generate
electricity during the lunar night. But they'll do the groundwork to enable
humans to stay permanently. Our first crew will consist of scientists and engineers who will study the composition of the Moon and whose experiments will explore ways
of using the available lunar material. Say, and purifying the lunar ice and turning
it into the water for human use. And water is important for far more than drinking. They can use it to experiment with growing plants for food. Hydrogen fuel cells will store power through the long night, extending astronauts' stays. And most importantly: It could be split into hydrogen and oxygen. Rocket fuel! By harvesting water from the Moon and putting it into orbit, the Moon base will supply an orbital depot. Where scientific missions to Mars and the outer solar system can refuel. Compared to the Earth, it's much easier and cheaper to get things off the Moon into orbit. Colonizing Mars may mean starting from the Moon. But this isn't a true colony, not yet. The base will be abandoned if funding stops. If we want our base to grow into the third phase, into a true colony, it must become self-sufficient supporting itself via exports to Earth. Now, private contractors arrive looking to get rich off lunar resources and support services. If it's cheaper to produce rocket fuel in space, what else can they get rich on? They could extract precious metals, abundant in impact craters and other raw materials from the lunar regolith. One promising possibility is the mining of Helium-3, an isotope that could one day be used in nuclear fusion reactors, something the Chinese lunar exploration
program is currently looking into. Future colonists may export Helium-3 back to Earth, providing us with cheap and clean fusion energy. Asteroids could be pulled into the Moon's orbit and then mined. With commercial exports to Earth, the colony is fully in its third phase, self-sufficient and economically productive. Our base will begin using lunar material in its construction projects if it's to continue growing. Fortunately, lunar soil has all the necessary
ingredients to make concrete. Robotic mining rigs can sift the lunar dust for organic molecules and could be used to build huge structures way too massive to be brought from Earth. While advances in 3D printing, will make it possible to produce almost
everything else the crews need. It's hard to say when exactly the colony
becomes self-sustaining. Growth is gradual, experiments are replaced by industry and the population steadily reaches the hundreds, encompassing more than just scientists. Engineers, pilots, and contractors representing countries and corporations will be present. Two of these people will make a breakthrough. Not scientific, but social. They will have the first extraterrestrial child. Throughout history, the birth of the first child was celebrated
as a moment where the seed of a colony finally and irreversibly took root. Here, it means that the Moon is not just a place for scientists and engineers to work, it's a place for people to live, to raise a family. Once this transition happens, the colony grows rapidly, building more habitats and schools and farms and all the things needed to support the growing population. As our colony grows, all kinds of new technologies will be invented to sustain it. They might develop crops that efficiently recycle carbon dioxide, or the grow with very little water. They might find ways to recycle and reuse 100% of their waste, technologies that are extremely valuable for Earth. They could even build the first space elevator in the solar system. With a space elevator, spacecraft, astronauts and raw materials, could be brought back and forth from lunar orbit, without needing to use rockets at all. The Moon may become a hub for economic activity on a scale that's hard to imagine right now. It's hard to say who will own the colony at this point. Will the first person born on the Moon
take the national identity of their parents, or will a new generation meld together
into a new lunar society? And when existing treaties that bar any nation from owning the moon are inevitably rewritten, will the colonists be given a say? Will they declare independence from the Earth? However it happens, the Moon is a perfect sandbox to learn
how to colonize the Solar System, the perfect project unify nations, and the only way to guarantee our survival as a species, should something tragic happen on Earth? If we ever want to colonize the Milky Way, we'll have to start somewhere. So why not start there? Why not start now?"
9P6rdqiybaw,2018-08-12T12:29:47.000000,Wormholes Explained – Breaking Spacetime,"If you saw a wormhole in reality, it would appear round, spherical, a bit like a black hole. Light from the other side passes through and gives you a window to a faraway place. Once crossed, the other side comes fully into view with your old home now receding into that shimmering spherical window. But are wormholes real, or are they just magic disguised as physics and maths? If they are real, how do they work and where can we find them? [Kurzgesagt Intro] For most of human history, we thought space was pretty simple; a big flat stage where the events of the universe unfold. Even if you take down the set of planets and stars, there's still something left. That empty stage is space and it exists, unchanging and eternal. Einstein's theory of relativity changed that. It says that space and time make up that stage together, and they aren't the same everywhere. The things on the stage can affect the stage itself, stretching and warping it. If the old stage was like unmoving hardwood, Einstein's stage is more like a waterbed. This kind of elastic space can be bent and maybe even torn and patched together, which could make wormholes possible. Let's see what that would look like in 2D. Our universe is like a big flat sheet, bent in just the right way, wormholes could connect two very, very distant spots with a short bridge that you could cross almost instantaneously. Enabling you to travel the universe even faster than the speed of light. So, where can we find a wormhole? Presently, only on paper. General relativity says they might be possible, but that doesn't mean they have to exist. General relativity is a mathematical theory. It's a set of equations that have many possible answers, but not all maths describes reality. But they are theoretically possible and there are different kinds. EINSTEIN ROSEN BRIDGES The first kind of wormholes to be theorized were Einstein Rosen Bridges. They describe every black hole as a sort of portal to an infinite parallel universe. Let's try to picture them in 2D again. Empty space time is flat, but curved by objects on it. If we compress that object, space-time gets more curved around it. Eventually, space-time becomes so warped that it has no choice but to collapse into a black hole. A one-way barrier forms: the event horizon, which anything can enter but nothing can escape; trapped forever at the singularity at its core. But maybe there is no singularity here. One possibility is that the other side of the event horizon looks a bit like our universe again but mirrored upside down, where time runs backwards. In our universe things fall into the black hole. In the parallel universe, with backwards time, the mirror black hole is spewing things out a bit like a big bang. This is called a white hole. Unfortunately, Einstein-rosen bridges can't actually be crossed. It takes an infinite amount of time to cross over to the opposite universe and they crimp shut in the middle. If you go into a black hole, you won't become the stuff coming out of the white hole. You'll only become dead. So, to travel the cosmos in the blink of an eye, humans need a different kind of wormhole; a Traversable Wormhole. VERY OLD STRING THEORY WORMHOLES If string theory or one of its variations is the correct description of our universe, then we could be lucky and our universe might even have a tangled web of countless wormholes already. Shortly after the Big Bang, Quantum fluctuations in the universe at the smallest scales far far smaller than an atom may have created many, many traversable wormholes. Threaded through them are strings, called cosmic strings. In the first billionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the ends of these tiny, tiny wormholes were pulled light-years apart; scattering them through the universe. If wormholes were made in the early universe, whether with cosmic strings or some other way, they could be all over; just waiting to be discovered. One might even be closer than we realize. From the outside, black holes and wormholes can look very similar; leading some physicists to suggest the supermassive black holes in the center of galaxies are actually wormholes. It will be very hard to go all the way to the center of the Milky Way to find out though, but that's okay. There might be an equally extremely hard way to get our hands on a wormhole, we could try to make one. MANMADE WORMHOLES To be traversable and useful, there are a few properties we want a wormhole to have. First, it must obviously connect to distant parts of space-time. Like your bedroom and the bathroom, or Earth and Jupiter. Second, it should not contain any event horizons, which would block two-way travel. Third, it should be sufficiently sized so that the gravitational forces don't kill human travelers. The biggest problem we have to solve, is keeping our wormholes open. No matter how we make wormholes, gravity tries to close them. Gravity wants to pinch it closed and cut the bridge; leaving only black holes at the ends. Whether it's a traversable wormhole with both ends in ours, or a wormhole to another universe, it will try to close unless we have something propping it open. For very old string theory wormholes, that's the cosmic strings job. For man-made wormholes, We need a new ingredient. Exotic matter. This isn't anything like we find on earth, or even antimatter. It's something totally new and different and exciting, with crazy properties like nothing that's ever been seen before. Exotic matter is stuff that has a negative mass. Positive mass like people and planets and everything else in the universe, is attractive because of gravity. But negative mass would be repulsive; it would push you away. This makes a kind of anti-gravity the props open our wormholes. And exotic matter must exert enormous pressure to push space-time open, greater even than the pressure of the centers of neutron stars. With exotic matter, we could weave space-time however we see fit. We may even have a candidate for this exotic matter, the vacuum of space itself. Quantum fluctuations in empty space are constantly creating pairs of particles and antiparticles, only for them to be annihilated an instant later. The vacuum of space is boiling with them, and we can already manipulate them to produce an effect similar to the negative mass we're looking for. We could use this to stabilize our wormholes. Once we're keeping it open, the ends would start together. So, we'd have to move them around to interesting places. We could start by wiring the solar system; leaving one end of each wormhole in orbit around the earth. We could flick others into deep space. The earth could be a wormhole hub for a vast interstellar human civilization spread over light-years, but only a wormhole away. However, wormholes have a dark side. Even opening a single wormhole, kind-of breaks the universe in fundamental ways, potentially creating time travel paradoxes, and violating the causal structure of the universe. Many scientists think that this not only means they should be impossible to make, but that it's impossible for them to exist at all. So, for now, we only know that wormholes exist in our hearts, and on paper in the form of equations."
9tbxDgcv74c,2018-07-22T12:30:03.000000,What If You Detonated a Nuclear Bomb In The Marianas Trench? (Science not Fantasy),"What would happen if we detonated humanity's most powerful nuclear weapon at the deepest point of the ocean? For sure, tsunamis hundreds of meters high would destroy coastal cities, earthquakes would level countries, new volcanoes would bring us nuclear winter. Maybe even Earth could be ripped apart? Or thrown out of orbit? Well, almost. Currently, Earth's deepest known point is inside the Mariana Trench. The Mariana Trench is a very deep valley right at the edge of two tectonic plates that looks like an upside-down mountain. It reaches a depth of about 11 kilometers, almost three times deeper than
the dark grave of the Titanic. It's one of the last places on Earth for humans to explore. Pitch black and under a thousand atmospheres of pressure, it's a relatively pristine environment thanks to the absence of humans. A great place for our nuclear test. We'll use the most powerful nuclear bomb humans have ever exploded, the RDS-220 hydrogen bomb or Tsar Bomba. Its explosion was so massive that its shockwave traveled around the Earth three times, and its mushroom cloud stretched 56 kilometers into the sky. Its shockwave was strong enough to destroy everything in a thousand square kilometers, its fireball hot enough to burn the rubble. Bombs like this release such an enormous amount of energy at once, that they could boil away an entire lake. And if we set off a nuclear bomb in the Mariana Trench, that's exactly what happens. Let's pull the trigger. In the first few microseconds, the nuclear fuel undergoes its chain reaction and explodes with the power of 50 megatons of TNT. A blinding flash of light illuminates the darkness of the trench for the first time in history. The heat of the explosion produces a cavity, a flaming bubble of water vapor, radioactive nuclei, and the remains of very unlucky fish. The bubble grows quickly as it vaporizes the water around it. The pressure of the bubble is immense, plowing outwards as if there's nothing in the way. Sending off a shockwave that will be felt by seismic stations and whales around the world. And then, almost as fast as it emerges, it stops. On the surface of the Earth, this fireball bubble would grow to ten kilometers the second after it's detonated, as the atmosphere barely puts up a fight to hold it back. But the pressure at the bottom of
the Mariana Trench is enormous. With 11 kilometres of water overhead, being in the Mariana Trench is like being crushed by a hydraulic press from every direction. Here, a second after the detonation, our bubble is about a kilometer across, when oddly enough, it starts to shrink. The bubble overextends itself, losing pressure as it expands, until the water turns it back, recompressing it. The tug of war between the fiery death bubble and water goes back and forth a few times, the bubble shrinking and growing, until eventually the bubble loses for good. The pressure around it is too great, and turbulent water begins to chop it up. It becomes something like the underwater equivalent of a mushroom cloud as it disintegrates into many smaller, hot and radioactive bubbles drifting upwards. And as our mighty destructive blast rises to the surface, it does basically nothing. Just a small wave, and a bubbling plume of radioactive warm water in the Pacific. No tsunami will wash away Japan or California, although boats and whales in the area might have a bad time. The radioactive fallout will be diluted into the Pacific after a few days, although a fair amount of radioactive water and salt makes it to the atmosphere where it collects and then rains down again. Even if the wind blows the fallout directly towards the Philippines, the worst of it probably happens over the oceans. But clearly, the real danger comes from our explosion-triggering earthquakes and volcanoes, right? Even if we detonated the bomb right in the trench at the exact point where tectonic plates touch, probably not. The explosion would vaporize a part of the seafloor, and turn a lot of sand into glass, but most of the energy goes into the water, not seismic waves. Earthquakes are already quite common at tectonic plate boundaries. And earthquakes with as much seismic energy as our bomb happen a few times a year without triggering any sort of apocalypse. But maybe it will affect the Earth's orbit. Since no mass is taken away or added to the Earth, our orbit is completely unaffected. Also, there have been well over a thousand nuclear tests in the last 70 years and that didn't change our orbit, so why would this time be different? The strongest forces humanity can unleash are laughable compared to the forces of nature. The planet is too big. It doesn't care. So, what happens to us if we detonate a nuclear weapon really deep in the ocean? Pretty much nothing. Did you know that every bird in our videos has an owner?

RS7IzU2VJIQ,2018-07-01T13:03:14.000000,Plastic Pollution: How Humans are Turning the World into Plastic,"When the gods granted king Midas one wish, he wished that everything he touched would turn to gold. Midas was delighted. Trees, rocks, buildings all gold. But soon he found in horror that his food turned into gold as well. When he hugged his daughter to soothe his pain, he realized his mistake too late. The richest man in existence was starving, heartbroken and alone. Humanity got a similar wish granted when we learned how to turn brown stinky goo into magic - plastic. Cheap, sterile and convenient it changed our lives But this wonder of technology got a little out of hand. Plastic has saturated our environment. It has invaded the animals we eat and now it's finding its way into our bodies. [Catchy intro music] What is plastic? For most of our history humans used stuff we found in nature to build the things we needed. But the invention of plastic roughly 100 years ago completely changed our world. Plastic is made from polymers - long repeating chains of molecule groups. In nature, polymers exist everywhere : the walls of cells, silk, hair, insect carapaces, DNA. But it's also possible to create them. By breaking down crude oil into its components and Rearranging them, we can form new synthetic polymers. Synthetic polymers have extraordinary traits. They are lightweight, durable and can be molded into almost any shape. Not requiring time-consuming manual work, plastic can be easily mass-produced and its raw materials are a vailable in vast amounts And incredibly cheaply, and so the golden era of plastics began Bakelite was used for mechanical parts, PVC for plumbing electric gears and cases, Acrylic is a shatter resistant alternative to glass and nylon for stockings and war equipment Today almost everything is at least partly made from plastic. Our clothes, phones, computers, furniture, appliances, houses and cars. Plastic has long ceased to be a revolutionary material instead it became trash. Coffee cups, plastic bags, or stuff to wrap a banana. We don't think about this fact a lot. Plastic just appears and goes away. Unfortunately, it doesn't Since synthetic polymers are so durable, plastic takes between 500 and 1,000 years to break down. But somehow we collectively decided to use this super tough material for things meant to be thrown away. 40% of plastics are used for packaging. In the United States, packaging makes up 1/3 of all the waste that is generated annually. Since its invention, we have produced about 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic. 335 million tons in 2016 alone. More than 6.3 billion metric tons of plastic have become waste since 1907. Piled up in one place, that makes a cube with a side length of 1.9 kilometers. So what did we do with all this waste? 9% was recycled, 12% burnt. But 79% of it is sticking around still. A lot ends up in the ocean. Around 8 million tons a year. That's so much plastic that it will outweigh all the fish in the ocean by 2050. Because it's everywhere, marine animals keep getting trapped in plastic and swallowing it. In 2015 already 90% of seabirds had eaten plastic. Many animals starve with stomachs full of indigestible trash. In 2018 a dead sperm whale washed up in Spain. He had eaten 32 kilos of plastic bags, nets and a drum While this is tragic and makes for great magazine covers, there's an even more widespread, invisible form of plastic. Microplastics Microplastics are pieces smaller than 5 millimeters Some of them are used in cosmetics or toothpaste, but most result from floating waste that is constantly exposed to UV radiation And crumbles into smaller and smaller pieces 51 trillion such particles float in the ocean, Where they are even more easily swallowed by all kinds of marine life. This has raised concerns among scientists, especially about health risks from the chemicals that are added to plastic. BPA for example makes plastic bottles transparent But there's also evidence that it interferes with our hormonal system. DEHP makes plastics more flexible, But may cause cancer. It would be pretty bad if micro plastics are toxic, because they travel up the food chain. Zooplankton eat micro plastic. Small fish eat zooplankton. So do oysters, crabs and predatory fish and they all land on our plate. Micro plastics have been found in honey, in sea salt, in beer, in tap water and in the household dust around us. 8 out of 10 babies and nearly all adults have measurable amounts of phthalates, a common plastic additive in their bodies. And 93% of people have BPA in their urine There is little science about this so far and right now it's inconclusive. We need a lot more research before panic is justified. But it is safe to say that a lot of stuff happened that we didn't plan for. And we have lost control Over plastic to a certain extent which is kind of scary. But just to make sure we should simply ban plastics, right? Unfortunately, it's a bit more complicated than that. Plastic pollution is not the only environmental challenge we face. Some of the substitutes we'd use for plastic have a higher environmental impact in other ways. For example : according to a recent study by the Danish government, making a single-use plastic bag requires so little energy and produces far lower carbon dioxide emissions compared to a reusable cotton bag, that you need to use your cotton bag 7 thousand 100 times before it would have a lower impact on the environment than the plastic bag. We're left with a complex process of trade-offs. Everything has an impact somehow, and it's hard to find the right balance between them. Plastic also helps solve problems that we don't have very good answers for at the moment. Globally, one-third of all food that's produced is never eaten and ends up rotting away on landfills where it produces methane. And the best way of preventing food from spoiling and avoiding unnecessary waste is still plastic packaging. It's also important to note where the vast majority of the world's plastic pollution is coming from right now. 90% of all plastic waste entering the ocean through rivers comes from just ten rivers in Asia and Africa. The Yangtze in China alone flushes 1.5 million tons of plastic into the ocean each year. Countries like China, India Algeria or Indonesia industrialized at an impressive pace in the last few decades, transforming the lives of billions of people This development was so fast, that the garbage disposal infrastructure couldn't keep up with collecting and recycling all the new waste this brought If politicians in Europe and the US want to address this issue, investing in infrastructure in developing countries is just as important as fighting plastic pollution at home with campaigns and redesigning products to minimize unnecessary plastic production. The bottom line is, as long as we don't address plastic pollution from a global perspective, we will not solve it. Plastic pollution is a complicated problem. We found a magic material and we had a really good time with it, But we need to be careful or just like Midas, we'll end up in a world that we didn't wish for. Your individual daily actions still have a huge impact. What you do matters! Refuse disposable plastics. Convince your friends and family to do the same. Pressure companies and politicians to take the necessary steps to keep our oceans clean and our food safe. Together we can beat plastic pollution!

kP15q815Saw,2018-06-10T12:30:12.000000,3 Arguments Why Marijuana Should Stay Illegal Reviewed,"All around the world, marijuana is being decriminalized, or even made legal. But is this really a good idea? In the online debate, the harmful sides are often downplayed. So let's look at the three most powerful arguments against legalizing marijuana. [Intro - Kurzgesagt] Argument number 1: In the last few decades, marijuana has been engineered
to become much more potent. Today, marijuana is so potent, that it's actually a strong drug
that may cause psychosis. The main active ingredient of marijuana is THC, and there's strong evidence
that THC is related to psychosis regardless of other risk factors. Marijuana also contains a substance called CBD, that seems to counteract its effect. It's even being tested as a treatment
against psychosis and anxiety. But because it doesn't make you high, growers have gradually decreased the amount of CBD in marijuana over the last few decades, while increasing THC levels. Sample testing showed that THC levels have risen from around 4% in the 1990s to nearly 12% in 2014, to nearly 12% in 2014, shifting the ratio of THC to CBD
from 1:14 in 1995 to about 1:80 in 2014. It's unclear how precise those tests were, however. Overall, recent findings suggest
that the more marijuana you consume, and the stronger it is, the higher your risk of developing psychosis. But how high is the risk of psychosis
for the general population? A study from Britain found that while marijuana use has risen significantly
between 1996 and 2005, the number of schizophrenia cases – a type of psychosis – remain stable. The risk of marijuana induced psychosis remains the highest for people who already have a high risk of psychosis to begin with. For them, it seems more likely that marijuana speeds up
the development of their condition, rather than causing it,
as far as we know right now. So the reasoning goes, if fewer people have access to marijuana, the lower the risk of marijuana-induced psychosis. But actually, you could argue that precisely because marijuana is illegal, more people will end up with psychosis. Prohibition makes illegal drug stronger and more potent, because this way you can ship
more product in a smaller space and sell it at a greater profit. This is what happened during
the prohibition of alcohol in the US, where hard liquor became the norm. And the same is happening with marijuana now. Imagine a world where liquor
is the only alcohol available. You have the choice of either not drinking at all, or getting much drunker than you would like to. This is the situation for many marijuana smokers today. People didn't stop drinking during prohibition, and the numbers show that laws
don't deter people from using marijuana. We can't make marijuana go away, but we can make it safer. If marijuana were legal, there would be more options for consumers, and regulators could, for example,
insist on a high level of CBD. Just like most people don't drink
an after-work bottle of vodka, many people would gladly consume
the after-work beer version of marijuana. Argument 2:
Marijuana is a gateway drug. If it's legalized, there will be a spike in the use
of much more dangerous drugs. A 2015 study found that about 45% of lifelong marijuana users took some other illegal drug at some point. Legalizing marijuana could reinforce this trend: As more young people try legal marijuana, they might end up trying harder drugs. But it turns out that the real gateway
to drug use comes much earlier: Cigarettes. One study showed that teens who started smoking before the age of 15 were 80% more likely to use illegal drugs
than those who didn't. And a 2007 study found that teenagers
between 12 and 17 who smoked were three times more likely to binge drink, seven times more likely to have used
drugs like heroin or cocaine, and were also seven times more likely
to resort to marijuana. But if that's the case, how could making more drugs legal
stop the use of hard drugs? At first, it's important to acknowledge that people don't use drugs because they're legal or not. If you want to buy any drug, you'll always find someone happy to sell. The real question is why do people develop an unhealthy relationship with drugs at all? Studies show that certain conditions make people especially vulnerable
to drugs and addiction. A difficult childhood, early trauma, low social status, depression, even genetic factors. Which drug they get addicted to
is more often than not a matter of chance. Addicts take drugs to escape their problems. But drugs don't solve any of those problems, and instead become a new problem. But punishing people
for their unhealthy coping mechanisms doesn't change anything about
the underlying causes either. So some argue we need to
take a completely different route. In 2001, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe. So it was desperate enough to try something radical: Possession and use of
all illegal drugs was decriminalized. You would no longer be arrested; instead, authorities launched a major health campaign. People who were found with a small amount were referred to support services, and got help with treatment and harm reduction. Drug use was seen as a chronic disease, not a crime. The results were stunning: the number of people
who tried drugs and kept using them fell from 44% to 28% by 2012. The use of hard drugs decreased, as well as HIV & hepatitis infections
and overdoses. Making drugs legal might overall
help society much more than it harms it. Argument number 3: Marijuana is addictive and unhealthy. It needs to remain illegal
to keep harm at a minimum. While marijuana addiction is
more psychological than physical, it is still a real problem. The demand for treatment
for marijuana addiction has more than doubled in the past decade alone. In total, about 10% of people
who try marijuana will become addicted. This is also related to higher THC levels. A study released in 2017 tracked the potency of marijuana
in Dutch coffee shops over a period of 16 years. For every 1% increase in THC, 60 more people enter treatment nationwide. In terms of negative health effects, some studies linked marijuana use to
increased blood pressure and lung problems, while a 2016 study found that
marijuana use was unrelated to physical health problems,
except for a higher risk of gum disease. Some studies showed that
marijuana use alters teenagers brains, and decreases their intelligence; but when more recent studies
took drinking and smoking into account, the results were inconclusive. Overall, research shows that taking any drugs while the brain
is still in development is bad for you. But the truth is, we don't know yet
how unhealthy marijuana is. We need more funding for research, which is hard to get while marijuana remains illegal. We can put what we know into perspective though. 16% of people who consume alcohol
become alcoholics, and 32% of people who try cigarettes
become smokers. We know for sure alcohol affects your brain, destroys your liver and causes cancer; while tobacco clogs your arteries, destroys your lungs and also causes cancer. 3.3 million people die from alcohol abuse each year, while smoking kills more than 6 million people. Nobody is suggesting tobacco and alcohol
are harmless just because they're legal. Also, nobody is seriously proposing to prohibit them even though they are extremely dangerous. Legality is a way to exercise some control over them, especially when it comes to protecting young people. It's often much harder to buy legal drugs
for teenagers than to buy illegal ones. Official sellers can get hefty fines and lose their license if they sell to underage kids. Legality creates incentives here
that drug dealers can't exploit. So making marijuana legal doesn't mean endorsing it. It means taking responsibility for the risks it poses. It could also open the floodgates
to tons of new research that shows us how harmful
it really is, and to whom. Conclusion: Marijuana is a drug, and just like any other drug,
It has negative consequences for a sizable portion of the people who use it. It is not harmless. The best way to protect society
from its negative consequences seems to be legalization and regulation. Thanks to our partnership with funk, this video has already been available on our German channel for two weeks!

YI3tsmFsrOg,2018-05-13T12:00:22.000000,The Deadliest Being on Planet Earth – The Bacteriophage,"[Music] A war has been raging for billions of years, killing trillions every single day, while we don't even notice. The war is fought by the single deadliest entity on our planet: the bacteriophage or 'phage' for short. [Intro + Music] A phage is a virus; not quite alive, not quite dead. Also, they look as if someone made them up. Their head is an icosahedron, a sort of dice with 20 faces and 30 edges. It contains the genetic material of the virus and often sits on a long tail that has leg-like fibers. There are more phages on earth than every other organism combined, including bacteria. And they are probably everywhere living things exist. Billions are on your hands, in your intestines and your eyelids right now. Which might make you nervous since phages are responsible for the majority of deaths on earth but you're lucky. While they do commit genocide for breakfast, they only kill bacteria. Up to 40% of all bacteria in the oceans are killed by them every single day. But phages also have major flaws. Like any other virus, phages need a host to survive and reproduce. They're not much more than genetic material in a hull and they specialize. Usually, a phage has chosen one specific bacteria and maybe some of its very close relatives. These are its prey. Imagine a phage as like a cruise missile that only hunts and kills members of one very unlucky family. When a phage finds its victim, it connects its tail fibers with receptors and uses a sort of syringe to puncture a surface. In a weird motion, the phage squeezes its tail and injects its genetic information. Within minutes, the bacteria is taken over. It's now forced to manufacture all the parts of new phages. They only stop when the bacteria is filled up with brand-new phages. In the final step, they produce 'endolysin', a powerful enzyme that punches a hole in the bacteria. The pressure is so high that the bacteria sort of vomits out all of its insides and dies. New phages are released and begin the cycle anew. In the last few years, bacteriophages have enjoyed the attention of the second deadliest beings on earth: humans. Recently, we've started looking into injecting millions of them into our bodies because we're sort of getting desperate; we screwed up. In the past a single cut or a sip from the wrong puddle could kill you. Bacteria were our phages. Tiny monsters that hunted us mercilessly. But then, about 100 years ago, we found a solution in nature. By accident, we found fungi that produced compounds that killed bacteria: antibiotics. Suddenly, we had a powerful super weapon. Antibiotics were so effective that we stopped thinking of bacteria as monsters. Only the old and the weakest among us were killed by them. We used antibiotics more and more for less and less serious causes. We lost respect for the monsters and the weapon But bacteria are living things that evolve and one by one they started to become immune against our weapons. This continued until we had created what are called 'superbugs', bacteria immune to almost everything we have. This immunity is spreading across the world as we speak. By 2050, superbugs could kill more humans a year than cancer. The days when a cut or bladder infection or a cough could kill you or your loved ones are coming back. In the US alone, more than 23,000 people die from resistant bacteria each year. But it turns out that phages, our tiny killer virus robots, could save us. We can inject them into our bodies to help cure infections. Hold on, how could injecting millions of viruses into an infection be a good idea? Phages are very very specialized killers of bacteria. So specialized, in fact, that humans are completely immune to them; we are too different. We encounter billions of phages every day and we just politely ignore each other. Antibiotics are like carpet bombing, killing everything even the good bacteria in our intestines that we don't want to harm Phages are like guided missiles that only attack what they're supposed to Wait a minute, if we use phages to kill bacteria, won't bacteria develop ways of defending themselves? Well, it's more complex than that; phages evolved too. There has been an arms race between them and bacteria for billions of years and so far, they're doing great. This makes phages smart weapons that are constantly getting better at killing. But even if bacteria were to become immune against our phage, we still might be able to win. It turns out that in order to become resistant to even just a few species of phages, bacteria have to give up their resistance to antibiotics. We might be able to trap them in a catch-22. This has already been successfully tested with a patient who had no other hope left The bacteria 'Pseudomonas Aeruginosa', one of the most feared bacteria, infected the man's chest cavity. They are naturally resistant to most antibiotics and can even survive an alcoholic hand gel. After years of suffering, a few thousand phages were directly inserted into his chest cavity together with antibiotics the bacteria were immune to. After a few weeks, the infections had completely disappeared. Unfortunately, this treatment is still experimental and pharma companies are still reluctant to invest the necessary billions in a treatment that has no official approval yet. But things are finally changing. In 2016, the largest phage clinical trial to date began and phages are getting more and more attention. and we better get used to it because the era in which antibiotics have been our super weapon is drawing to a close. It might be a weird concept but injecting the deadliest being on planet Earth directly into our bodies could save millions of lives This video was made possible by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation If you'd like to support Kurzgesagt, you can do so on patreon.com/Kurzgesagt and get fancy things in return."
ulCdoCfw-bY,2018-04-22T12:02:17.000000,The Black Hole Bomb and Black Hole Civilizations,"Black holes are the largest collections of pure violent energy in the universe. If you come too close, they'll devour you and add your energy to their collection. And so, the energy is lost to us forever. Or is it? It turns out there's a universe cheat code. A way of powering civilizations until the very death of everything, or of constructing the largest bomb in the universe. But how? Didn't we learn that all energy is trapped forever in black holes, even light? This is true. Everything you think you know about the weirdest thing in the universe is about to get weirder, for one simple reason: Black holes are spinning. When really really massive stars die, their cores collapse under their own gravity into black holes. This means something very big becomes very, very tiny. Like the tiniest anything can be in this universe. But stars are rotating and a fundamental property of our universe is that things that are spinning don't want to stop spinning. We call this: angular momentum. And this angular momentum can't go away. A big thing that spins and becomes smaller, spins faster. So, as the core of a star collapses, its momentum makes it spin faster and faster and faster, until it collapses into a black hole . And the black hole keeps on spinning, inconceivably fast. Some of them spin millions of times a second. Just like non spinning black holes, ...spinning black holes have an event horizon and a singularity at their core, where all of their mass is concentrated. The singularity is usually described as a single infinitely small point with no surface area. But points can't rotate, so a rotating singularity can't be a point. Instead, it's a RINGularity. A ringularity is a ring with a thickness of zero and no surface, spinning extremely fast, containing all the mass of the black hole. The black hole is spinning so fast, that it morphs space and time itself. It literally drags space with it, such is its power. This creates a new and super weird region of space-time: the Ergosphere, which envelops the black hole. If space and time are completely broken inside the event horizon, then they're only half broken inside the ergosphere. Inside the ergosphere, nothing makes sense. It's possible to enter it and then leave it again, but it's probably not a great experience. You can imagine it like this: Falling into a static black hole is like sliding down a hole. Being inside the ergosphere of a spinning black hole is like spiraling down a deadly drain. The black hole transfers its own kinetic energy in the form of rotation, to everything that enters the ergosphere. The ringularity makes you dance whether you want to or not. You need to move faster than the speed of light just to stand still here, which is impossible. But here's our cheat code: We can steal this energy, and there's a lot of energy to steal. Take the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. We could steal as much energy from it as every single star in the Milky Way emits in a billion years combined. The easiest way to steal this energy is, oddly enough, to drop something into the black hole. We've seen that the ringularity forces energy on us when we enter the ergosphere, ...which is a lot like being in a whirlpool, with space-time rushing around and around. If you're clever you can use the water to your advantage, and swim faster than before. In practice, this means sending a rocket into the ergosphere, and making a trade with the black hole: We give it some mass-energy, and it gives us some of its rotational energy. But it's not a fair trade, we get the better deal. Normally, if you fire a rocket, you exchange chemical energy for kinetic energy. This is like pushing yourself forward in a swimming pool. But if you fire a rocket inside the ergosphere, it's like pushing yourself forward in a wave pool. The rotational energy of the waves gives you a much stronger boost than you could get just by pushing yourself. The boost from the rotation of the back hole is so big, that you leave the ergosphere with much more energy than you entered it. The black hole gives a tiny amount of its rotational energy to you, and slows down a little. Obviously, this requires a lot of food. Fortunately, black holes aren't picky eaters. An advanced future civilization would probably harvest asteroids to drop them into the black hole when they needed an energy boost. But there's an even better way to get energy from a black hole, and oddly enough, it builds the biggest bomb any living thing could ever hope to build: We only need two things to build a black hole bomb: a fast-spinning black hole, and a big mirror. The mirror has to completely envelop the black hole, ...which is similar to a Dyson Sphere, a mega structure that harvests the energy of an entire star. Although, our mirror would be easier to build. Mirrors are simpler, and black holes are much, much more compact than stars. If we made the mirror 10 centimeters thick, the metal of a big asteroid would probably be enough material for a black hole with the mass of our Sun. Once our mirror is in place, we only need to open a window, and shoot electromagnetic waves at the black hole. You can imagine what happens next, by imagining tossing a ball at a wall, and it coming back faster than a bullet. The waves hit the black hole at light speed. A small proportion of the waves falls past the event horizon to disappear forever. But a much larger amount sloshes through the ergosphere, ...where the black hole forces some of its rotational energy on them, and amplifies them. They now begin superradiant scattering, which are fancy science words meaning: ""Bouncing around between mirror and black hole and getting stronger."" Every time they go around, they are getting exponentially stronger. By opening some windows in the mirror, we can extract the energy from the waves as fast as they grow. Which we could use, in theory, to create what would be for all practical purposes, an endless source of energy for trillions of years. Or, we could blow it up. If the waves are not released, they will continue to get stronger and stronger, ...and take more and more energy from the black hole, until the mirror shatters. A supermassive black hole would release as much energy as a supernova, ...making the bomb the largest explosion any living being could ever create. The beauty of the black hole bomb, the Penrose process, and the super radiant scattering, is that they are not science-fiction. In the far far future, this might be the only way to survive in our dying universe. After all the red dwarfs have cooled down, and all the white dwarfs transformed into black dwarfs, the universe will turn dark forever. Rotating black holes might be the only sources of energy in the entire universe that life could harvest. If so, the last living being in existence might one day end its life around a black hole. Which is equally chilling and uplifting. It turns out that even without any light, there are places we can go."
5TbUxGZtwGI,2018-04-08T12:26:40.000000,Time: The History & Future of Everything – Remastered,"Time... makes sense in small pieces. But when you look at huge stretches of time, it's almost impossible to wrap your head around things. So, let's start small-- with minutes, hours, days. You probably spent the last 24 hours mostly sleeping and working, and you probably wasted a good chunk of yesterday on the Internet. Days become weeks, weeks become months, and then we have a year. Let's look at 2017. France started to train eagles to hunt terrorist drones, A Czech nuclear power plant held a bikini contest to pick their new intern, and people on the Internet made a challenge out of eating bleach. You know, the usual stuff. Let's go back further. A kid born in the first year of the 21st Century is 18 years old now. But the century is still young, even if you're not. It was largely shaped by the attacks on 9/11, which led to the war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq. In March 2011, the Syrian Civil War began, and is still ongoing after seven years. Most of us were born in the 20th century, which had the two most devastating wars in human history, and the Cold War. For the first time ever, we could destroy ourselves with the nuclear weapons, and we almost did, but we also had a space race and left Earth for the first time. The Internet was also invented, which led to memes , but also to Facebook and Twitter, so all in all, we're not sure if this was a GOOD development. The average human lives about 79 years, which covers a good chunk of recent history. The oldest living person on Earth is currently Celino Jaramillo, who was born in 1896, which means that his birth was closer to Napoleon ruling Europe than to the current day. Only 250 years ago, the Industrial Revolution turned the world into a progress machine. Farmers became workers, and knowledge became easier to distribute. Around this time, we started the progress that is causing climate change today. Not that long ago, actually. The Theory of Evolution changed how we saw ourselves and the world we live in. Newton wrote down his theory of gravity. We discovered distant stars and very close bacteria. The 15th century was very eventful. Columbus's ""discovery"" of America and the fall of Constantinople marked the end of the Middle Ages. War was all the rage in the Middle Ages, but the number one killer was disease. The Black Plague killed every third European in just six years. Around 2,000 years ago, we set the arbitrary Year 1 of our calendar that most of the world follows today. But to a Roman, the world was already ancient. The Great Pyramids were constructed 4,500 years ago. So, to a Roman, the pyramids were older than the Romans are to us today. So long ago, that there were still living mammoths on Earth. A lot of history happened before that, even. Around 7,000 years ago, humans began writing things down. About 12,000 years ago, human organization exploded. We built our first temple, and around the world, mankind began farming, which enabled the rise of larger communities. Our dominance over planet Earth really begins here. Homo sapiens sapiens, the modern human, evolved at least 200,000 years ago. 50,000 years ago, the Cognitive Revolution expanded our minds and innovation. Back then, we shared Earth with at least five other human species that either died out or were killed by us. At least 2 million years ago, our ancestors already had control over fire and constructed tools from wood and stone. And six million years ago, the last common ancestors of chimpanzees and humans existed. So this graph is all of human history. Our close relative, Homo erectus, survived 10 times longer than we have existed. This tiny part is the human era. We have to zoom in a lot to even see your lifetime. Still, all of human history is not that long. 65 million years ago, the age of the dinosaurs ended in an enormous explosion. The dinosaurs ruled the Earth for over 165 million years. 27 times as long as all humans. That's so long, that it means a T-rex that lived at 65 million years ago is closer to us today than to a live Stegosaurus. Dinosaurs in the form of mighty chickens are still around today. Animal life on this planet started 600 million years ago. The earliest animals were fish and other small simple sea creatures, then came insects, then reptiles and finally, around 200 million years ago, mammals joined the party. Life itself began much further back. There is evidence that it appeared up to 4.1 BILLION years ago. For at least 3.5 billion years, life consisted only of single-celled organisms. 4.5 billion years ago, the Sun was born from a gigantic imploding gas cloud. 60 million years later, Earth formed. In those early years, frequent bombardment by comets and asteroids supplied the Earth with large oceans. But as far as the whole universe goes, our solar system is pretty new. 13.75 billion years ago, the universe was born. And about half a billion years later, our own galaxy formed from billions of stars. But what came before the Big Bang? The truth is... we don't know, and maybe we never will. And there you have it... The past. Now let's take a look at what we know about the future. In roughly 1 billion years, the Sun will be so hot that life on Earth becomes impossible. The death of the Sun 4 billion years later marks the end of life in the solar system. If we want to have a chance to survive, we need to have ventured to the stars. And what happens after that? In the next 100 billion years, most of the biggest stars around will die. The universe becomes dimmer and dimmer, illuminated only by smaller red and white dwarfs. But they too will eventually burn out and one day... the last star in the universe will die. The universe will turn dark, and at some point, even black holes will evaporate and die. When they do our, universe will reach its final stage: Heat death. Nothing changes anymore; the universe is dead. Forever. Now, you're feeling some pretty weird feelings right now, aren't you? We are, too. It's only natural. The good news is this is all far, far away. The only time that actually matters is now. That cute girl or boy you like, ask them out! Time is precious. Make it count!"
rvskMHn0sqQ,2018-03-18T13:10:34.000000,A Selfish Argument for Making the World a Better Place – Egoistic Altruism,"Until recently, the vast majority of the world population worked on farms and the total production of the world's economy was mostly the total agricultural output. And this output was limited by the fixed size of the land. The total output of the economy did not change a lot year by year. The size of the pie was fixed; the world was a zero-sum game. In such a stagnating world,  the only way to get better off is if someone else gets worse off. if you take a bigger piece of the pie, someone else's gets smaller. If you want more food, then conquering, plundering, and stealing are great strategies. Your neighbors loss is your gain. This was the state of things for thousands of years. Societies invaded each other constantly to get more pie. Economic inequality was extreme. Some had all the pie they wanted, while others had to live with the crumbs. Then, the Industrial Revolution happened and everything changed. We developed machinery, better crops, better fertilizers. Agricultural output skyrocketed, but we didn't just produce more food - every industrial sector exploded in terms of productivity. From 1700 to 1870, the production of iron in Britain increased 137 fold. The Industrial Revolution led to a previously unimaginable increase in economic output. This altered the nature of our societies. Economic growth changed the world from a zero-sum game to a positive-sum game. We had found a way to create a bigger pie - but not only a bigger pie, but a pie that was growing bigger each year. More people could have more at the same time. This development is spreading and continuing today. Antibiotics kill bacteria. Power plants deliver energy. Cell phones connect us. Planes let us travel cheaply. Fridges store food. Continuous progress in all sectors of the economy seems normal to us today, but the change from stagnation to economic growth really was the most drastic shift in human history. How was this possible? At the very core of this massive transformation stand new ideas that lead to innovation. Innovation has many different definitions, but in the context of this video, we mean better solutions to existing problems and solutions to problems we didn't know we had. The more you innovate, the more complex and interesting problems you discover as your wishes and needs evolve. The average citizen in Norway 250 years ago might have wanted some really good shoes. 150 years ago, maybe a bicycle. 80 years ago, a car. 30 years ago, cheap air travel. And so on. Once we get what we want, we don't stop; we can see how we can improve things even more, and how to make things even better. The new positive-sum world has existed for 0.1% of human history and we have yet to get used to it. It has a consequence that feels really unintuitive. In a positive-sum world, it's in your personal selfish best interest that every human on planet earth is well off. It's good for you if people in obscure parts of countries you've never heard of are prospering. There is a genuine selfish argument for making the world a better place. In a positive-sum world, the more people are well-off, the better your own life is. This is because of the nature of innovation; it is fundamentally driven by supply and demand. The supply increases when more people have the freedom and education to contribute. They become inventors, researchers, engineers or thinkers that come up with new ideas. The demand for ideas increases as people get richer, and can pay for new solutions. They increase the size of the market for innovations. Innovation follows incentives. So naturally, if many people want and can pay for something, it will get the innovators attention and energy. Improving the lives of those who are worst off has a multiplying effect. It increases demand for ideas while at the same time, making it easier for ideas to be produced. Let's take an example that interests all of us - a cure for cancer. If there are 1 billion people in the world that have the wealth to pay for cancer treatments, innovation will follow this demand. So hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in medical research. This had a huge effect, but we're still nowhere near to curing all forms of cancer. Today, every sixth person in the world dies of cancer, and you might be one of them. Now, imagine if demand were higher. Imagine instead of 1 billion people being able to pay for a cure for cancer, there were 4 billion or 7 billion. Imagine how far medicine could have developed if we'd invested 7 times as much in curing cancer. On top of that, there's so much human potential being wasted right now. The work of a poor farmer in a developing nation is not useful to you. But if he becomes better off, his children might spend their time in university developing things that are useful to you. Instead of having some hotspots of innovation in the developed world, we would have many hotspots all over the world. The research output of humanity would be many times what it is right now. Could we have cured cancer by now if that were the case? Well, maybe. If we spent 7 times as much on research, had 7 times as many people working on it, and a global network of medical research, things would certainly be further ahead than they are now. And this is the core of the argument: the more people want the same thing that you want, the more likely you are to get it. That is what it means to live in a positive-sum world. You don't gain more pie if poor places stay poor. Instead, you get more pie if poor places get richer, contribute ideas, and grow the global pie. Do you like space travel? Imagine there were billions of people in Africa and Asia with their own space programs, and demand for satellites and moon bases and cities on Mars. Do you like being alive? A few billion people paying for medical research could literally save your life. It's in your interest for people around the world to become better off. The faster we get to this version of the world, the better for you personally. No matter what your motivation is, working on a better world is a very good thing to do - for others, and for you.

Da-2h2B4faU,2018-03-01T13:30:51.000000,String Theory Explained – What is The True Nature of Reality?,"What is the true nature of the universe? To answer this question, humans come up with stories to describe the world. We test our stories and learn what to keep and what to throw away. But the more we learn, the more complicated and weird our stories become. Some of them so much so, that it's really hard to know what they're actually about. Like string theory. A famous, controversial and often misunderstood story, about the nature of everything. Why did we come up with it and is it correct? Or just an idea we should chuck out? To understand the true nature of reality, we looked at things up close and were amazed. Wonderous landscapes in the dust, zoos of bizarre creatures, complex protein robots. All of them made from structures of molecules made up of countless even smaller things: Atoms. We thought they were the final layer of reality, until we smashed them together really hard and discovered things that can't be divided anymore: Elementary particles. But now, we had a problem: They are so small that we could no longer look at them. Think about it: what is seeing? To see something, we need light, an electromagnetic wave. This wave hits the surface of the thing and gets reflected back from it into your eye. The wave carries information from the object that your brain uses to create an image. So you can't see something without somehow interacting with it. Seeing is touching, an active process, not a passive one. This is not a problem with most things. But particles are But particles are very, But particles are very, very, But particles are very, very, very small. So small that the electromagnetic waves we used to see are too big to touch them. Visible light just passes over them. We can try to solve this by creating electromagnetic waves with more and much smaller wavelengths. But more wavelengths, means more energy. So, when we touch a particle with a wave that has a lot of energy it alters it. By looking at a particle, we change it. So, we can't measure elementary particles precisely. This fact is so important that it has a name: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The basis of all quantum physics. So, what does a particle look like then? What is its nature? We don't know. If we look really hard, we can see a blurry sphere of influence, but not the particles themselves. We just know they exist. But if that's the case, how can we do any science with them? We did what humans do and invented a new story: A mathematical fiction. The story of the point particle. We decided that we would pretend that a particle is a point in space. Any electron is a point with a certain electric charge and a certain mass. All indistinguishable from each other. This way physicists could define them and calculate all of their interactions. This is called Quantum Field Theory, and solved a lot of problems. All of the standard model of particle physics is built on it and it predicts lots of things very well. Some quantum properties of the electron for example have been tested and are accurate up to 0, 0,00 0,0000 0,000000 0,00000000 0,0000000000 0,000000000000 0,0000000000002 %. So, while particles are not really points, by treating them as if they were, we get a pretty good picture of the universe. Not only did this idea advance science, it also led to a lot of real-world technology we use everyday. But there's a huge problem: Gravity. In quantum mechanics, all physical forces are carried by certain particles. But according to Einstein's general relativity, gravity is not a force like the others in the universe. If the universe is a play, particles are the actors, but gravity is the stage. To put it simply, gravity is a theory of geometry. The geometry of space-time itself. Of distances, which we need to describe with absolute precision. But since there is no way to precisely measure things in the quantum world, our story of gravity doesn't work with our story of quantum physics. When physicists tried to add gravity to the story by inventing a new particle, their mathematics broke down and this is a big problem. If we could marry gravity to quantum physics and the standard model, we would have the theory of everything. So, very smart people came up with a new story. They asked: What is more complex than a point? A line- A line or a string. String theory was born. What makes string theory so elegant, is that it describes many different elementary particles as different modes of vibration of the string. Just like a violin string vibrating differently can give you a lot of different notes, a string can give you different particles Most importantly, this includes gravity. String theory promised to unify all fundamental forces of the universe. This caused enormous excitement and hype. String theory quickly graduated to a possible theory of everything Unfortunately, string theory comes with a lot of strings attached. Much of the maths involving a consistent string theory does not work in our universe with its three spatial and one temporal dimensions. String theory requires ten dimensions to work out. So, string theorists did calculations in model universes. And then try to get rid of the six additional dimensions and describe our own universe But so far, nobody has succeeded and no prediction of string theory has been proven in an experiment So, string theory did not reveal the nature of our universe. One could argue that in this case string theory really isn't useful at all. Science is all about experiments and predictions. If we can't do those, why should we bother with strings? It really is all about how we use it. Physics is based on maths. Two plus two makes four. This is true no matter how you feel about it. And the maths in string theory does work out. That's why string theory is still useful. Imagine that you want to build a cruise ship, but you only have blueprints for a small rowing boat. There are plenty of differences: the engine, the engine, the materials, the engine, the materials, the scale. But both things are fundamentally the same: Things that float. So, by studying the rowing boat blueprints, you might still learn something about how to build a cruise ship eventually. With string theory, we can try to answer some questions about quantum gravity that have been puzzling physicists for decades. Such as how black holes work or the information paradox. String theory may point us in the right direction. When used in this spirit, string theory becomes a precious tool for theoretical physicists and help them discover new aspects of the quantum world and some beautiful mathematics. So, maybe the story of string theory is not the theory of everything. But just like the story of the point particle, it may be an extremely useful story. We don't yet know what the true nature of reality is but we'll keep coming up with stories to try and find out. Until one day, Until one day, hopefully Until one day, hopefully, we do know.

8HslUzw35mc,2018-02-22T14:14:37.000000,Homeopathy Explained – Gentle Healing or Reckless Fraud?,"Homeopathy may be the most controversial but also the most popular alternative medicine. While some argue against it, others swear by its great power and effectiveness. How does homeopathy work? How did it become what it is today, and what can modern medicine learn from it? The first principle of homeopathy is ""like cures like."" Remedies use ingredients that cause the symptoms you want to cure. In practice, that means that remedies against fever could, for example, be made from belladonna, which also causes fever. A mixture based from bee venom is used to treat itchy swellings, and so on. The second principle is the special method of preparation called potentization. The idea is that diluting and agitating the ingredients activates their curative powers and enhances their effect. To do this, the ingredient is dissolved in alcohol or distilled water. Homeopaths take one part of the solution and mix it with nine parts of water, diluting it down to one tenth of its original concentration, and shaking it. What you have now is a 1X potency---one part ingredient and nine parts solvent---named after the Roman numeral X, for 10. one-part ingredient and nine parts solvent, named after the Roman numeral X, for 10. Now, this process is repeated. Take one part, mix it with nine parts of pure water and shake it vigorously. Now you have 2X. You do this again and again until you reach the desired grade of potency. The finished remedy is then taken orally, or sometimes it's applied as little sugar pellets that are sold as globuli. A 20X potency, for example, is like dissolving one aspirin pill in the water volume of the whole Atlantic. But many are much more extreme, like 30C, for example. C means that the mixture has one part ingredient and 99 parts water. So the commonly sold 30C mixture means one part ingredient and ..one million billion billion billion billion billion BILLION If we wanted a globuli pill with a single atom of the original ingredient, then our pill would be the diameter of the distance between the Earth and the Sun. 150,000,000 kilometers A pill so massive, that it would collapse into a black hole under its own mass. Because of this, potentization is one of the biggest criticisms of homeopathy. The extreme dilution is supposed to make the ingredients more potent, but on a physical level, this doesn't really make sense. Most homeopathic remedies are diluted so much that not a single atom of the active ingredient is left in them. The explanation of why the mixtures still work is that shaking the mixture after every dilution leaves behind a spirit-like essence of the ingredient. Basically, the idea is that water remembers what was put into it. But if this were true, then every substance that ever met a drop of water would leave an essence behind and lead to unpredictable effects when it was accidentally ingested. Think of all the stuff that lives and floats in the oceans. Every sip of water would be a supercharged homeopathic cocktail. So how did homeopathy become the most successful alternative medicine? In the 18th century, medicine was very different from today. Treatments like bloodletting left the patient worse off than before. So German physician Samuel Hahnemann wanted a non-invasive, natural way of healing and developed homeopathy. And, in fact, homeopathic hospitals were soon successful because doing no harm beats doing harm. Hahnemann imposed very strict rules on his patients. First you had to avoid coffee, tea, alcohol, spicy food, sweet food. No old cheese, no onions, no meat. No clothes made from sheep's wool, but also no sedentary work, no sitting inside in stuffy air, no warm rooms, no riding horses, no napping, no playing games, no masturbation, and of course, no reading pornographic texts, and many more. Then, and only then, would his remedies work, according to the inventor of homeopathy. Of course, all of these instructions are ignored and not talked about today. Of course, all of these instructions are ignored and not talked about today. Medicine has changed a lot in the last 150 years. Never before in human history have we enjoyed a comparable level of health. Never have we lived as long, and this is largely due to the new tools we've developed. Never have we lived as long, and this is largely due to the new tools we've developed. Modern diagnostics, double-blinded studies, and scientific evaluation to check and prove which stuff works. Thanks to these tools, after countless studies and reviews, we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that homeopathy does not have any effect beyond placebo. But even so, who cares why it works if it helps people? Maybe you tried it and felt better, or you know someone that got over a horrible disease while using homeopathic remedies, and there are plenty of reports of it working for children and animals. What do we make of these experiences? The Placebo Effect is very real and not imaginary. No matter how smart you are, you're not immune to it. If people believe that something will help them feel better, their trust alone has the desired effect. And it's been proven that the Placebo Effect can be transferred. Children and animals rely on their parents or keepers and are in tune to their emotions. If a parent has a lot of trust in a treatment and eases up, this can help a child relax and help relieve symptoms. This could also be observed with animals who react strongly to the body language cues of the people caring for them. But the most powerful tool of homeopathy is time. Our bodies are survival machines. Infections pass on their own after a few days. But if you take some remedy when you already feel sick, and then start getting better, it feels like it did indeed cure you, when actually, it would have happened anyway. The homeopathy industry likes to play the gentle alternative to Big Pharma. But the homeopathic industry IS Big Pharma. Billions of dollars are made with extreme profit margins. The homeopathy industry has its own lobby organizations and fights its enemies as hard as it can. A lot of money is on the line. Globally, the market is expected to reach over 17 billion by 2024. Some critics even argue that the homeopathic industry is bad for public health because it creates distrust in proven medicine. The belief in homeopathy correlates with skepticism about vaccinations. This can discourage people to seek the help they need when their lives or the lives of their children are on the line. But there is actually a key to the success of homeopathy that we could, and should, copy. The first consultation with a homeopath can take hours and is very personal. For a patient who's already been on a pilgrimage from doctor to doctor, this level of attention and empathy can make a huge difference to their well-being, even if the conversation was not the point of the therapy. Modern medicine is efficient. It saves millions of lives each year. But it's also a strictly organized system. Tight budgets force doctors and nurses to deal with lots of patients. Consultations need to be time-efficient, diagnoses made quickly, treatments fast, which can leave patients feeling invisible, scared, and left behind. This is what modern medicine can learn from homeopathy. It meets a human need that has been left unfulfilled. We need to make time for the individual again. See people, not numbers. But as important as empathy is, it's not a substitute for actual treatment. Faith can move mountains, but sugar water can't cure cancer. After a short break of a few years, Kurzgesagt is back in German. Thanks to the support of Funk, we have relaunched the German channel and are beginning to upload a video every 1-2 weeks. Besides redoing our favorite videos, there'll be a number of videos that will not exist in English for a while. Check out the channel here, tell us what you think, and subscribe and watch a few. If the channel goes well, the German videos might become a regular thing for years, and we might even do more languages."
UjtOGPJ0URM,2018-02-01T13:00:05.000000,Why Alien Life Would be our Doom - The Great Filter,"Imagine NASA announced today
that they found aliens. Bacteria on Mars, weird alien fish
in the oceans of Europa, and also ancient alien ruins on Titan. Wouldn't that be great? Well, no. It would be horrible news, devastating even. It could mean that the end of humanity
is almost certain and that it might be coming soon. Why? Why would the most exciting
discovery of our lifetime be bad? Let us imagine the development of life, from its inception to us today, as a flight of stairs. The first step is dead chemistry
that needs to assemble itself into self-replicating patterns,
stable and resilient, but also able to change and evolve. The second step is for our early life to
become more complex, able to build more complicated structures, and use the available energy
much more efficiently. On the next step, these cells combine
to become multicellular beings, enabling unbelievable variety
and further complexity. The step above sees the species
evolve big brains, enabling the use of tools, culture
and shared knowledge, which creates even higher complexity. The species can now become the
dominant lifeform on its planet, and change it according to its needs. First shy attempts to leave its
planet are happening. This is where we are now. It's in the nature of life as we know it to reach out, to cover every
niche it can. And since planets have a limited
carrying capacity and lifespan, if a species wants to survive, it will look for more places
to spread to. So the steps above the current
ones seem logical: colonize your own solar system, then spread further to reach
other stars, to the possible final step:
becoming a galaxy-wide civilization. It's very likely that this is a universal
principle for civilizations, no matter where they're from. If a species is competitive and driven
enough to take control over its planet, they'll probably not stop there. We know that there are up to 500 billion
planets in the Milky Way, at least 10 billion Earth-like planets. Many have been around billions
of years longer than Earth. But we're observing zero
galactic civilizations. We should be able to see something... ...but there's nothing. Space seems
to be empty and dead. This means something is preventing living
things from climbing the staircase, beyond the step we're on right now. ...Something that makes becoming
a galactic civilization extremely hard, maybe impossible. This is the Great Filter. ...A challenge or danger so
hard to overcome, that it eliminates almost every
species that encounters it. There are two scenarios: One means we are incredibly
special and lucky, the other one means we are doomed
and practically already dead. It depends on where the filter
is on our staircase: behind, or ahead of us? Scenario 1: Scenario 1:
The filter is behind us. We are the first. If the filter is behind us, that means that one of the steps we passed is almost impossible to take. Which step could it be? Is life ITSELF extremely rare? It's very hard to make predictions
about how likely it is for life to emerge from dead things. There is no consensus. Some scientists think it develops everywhere
where the conditions are right; others think that Earth might
be the ONLY living place in the universe. Another candidate is the step
of complex animal cells. A very specific thing happened
on this step, and as far as we know, it happened
exactly once. A primitive hunter cell
swallowed another cell, but instead of devouring it,
the two cells formed a union. The bigger cell provided shelter, took care of interacting with the
environment and providing resources, while the smaller one used its
new home and free stuff, to focus on providing a lot of extra
energy for its host. With the abundant energy, the host cell
could grow more than before and build new and expensive things
to improve itself, while the guest became the
powerhouse of the cell. These cells make up every
animal on the planet. Maybe there are billions of bacteria-covered planets in the Milky Way, but not a single one, apart from us, has achieved our level of complexity. ...or intelligence. We humans feel very smart and
sophisticated with our crossword puzzles and romantic novels. But a big brain, is first and foremost, a very expensive evolutionary investment. They are fragile, they don't help in a fistfight with a bear, they cost enormous amounts of energy, and despite them, it took modern humans, 200,000 years to get from sharp sticks
to civilization. Being smart does not mean you get
to win automatically. Maybe intelligence is just not so great, and we're lucky that it worked out for us. Scenario 2: Scenario 2:
The filter is ahead of us. Plenty of others died already. A Great Filter before us is orders of magnitude more dangerous than anything we encountered so far. Even if a major disaster killed most of us or threw us back thousands of years, we would survive and recover. And if we can recover, even if it takes a million years, then it's not a Great Filter, but just a roadblock to an eventual galactic civilization. On universal timescales, even millions of years are just the blink of an eye. If a Great Filter really lies before us, it has to be so dangerous, so purely devastating and powerful, that it has destroyed most, if not all, advanced civilizations in our galaxy over billions of years. A really daunting and depressing hypothesis is that once a species takes control over its planet, it's already on the path to self-destruction. Technology is a good way to achieve that. It needs to be something that's so obvious, that virtually everybody discovers it, and so dangerous, that its discovery leads almost universally to an existential disaster. A large-scale nuclear war, nanotechnology that gets out of control, genetic engineering of the perfect super bug, an experiment that lights the whole atmosphere on fire. It might be a super-intelligent AI that accidentally (or purposely) destroys its creators. Or things that we can't even see coming right now. Or it's way simpler: species competitive enough to take over their planet necessarily destroy it while competing with each other for resources. Maybe there are runaway chain reactions in every ecosystem that once set in motion, are not fixable. And so once a civilization is powerful enough to change the composition of its atmosphere, they make their planet uninhabitable 100% of the time. Let's hope that that's not the case. If the filter IS ahead of us, our odds are really bad. What we can hope for. THIS is why finding life beyond Earth would be horrible. The more common life is in the universe, and the more advanced and complex it is, the more likely it becomes that a filter is in front of us. Bacteria would be bad, small animals would be worse, intelligent life would be alarming. Ruins of ancient alien civilizations... would be horrible. The best case scenario for us right now is that Mars is sterile, that Europa's oceans are devoid of life, and the vast arms of the Milky Way harbor only empty oceans hugging dead continents. ...That there are billions of empty planets waiting to be discovered and to be filled up with life. Billions of new homes... waiting for us... to finally arrive."
MUWUHf-rzks,2017-12-21T13:38:50.000000,How to Make an Elephant Explode – The Size of Life 2,"Let's shrink an elephant to
the size of a mouse and enlarge a mouse, and make it
the size of an elephant, because this is our video,
and we want to see what happens. First: our now tiny elephant, stumbles around
and then drops dead. Tiny elephant buddy is very cold; frozen
to death in minutes. Our giant mouse looks very uncomfortable
for a moment, and then it explodes. leaving hot mouse insides everywhere. Why? Because of size. We are optimized to function precisely
for the size we are, and would die horribly
in any other environment. But, why exactly? Why does our mouse explode, and can we do this to our
elephant too, if we try hard? Life on this planet is based on cells. Cells do vary in size. But they're pretty similar in their dimensions
across all species. A blue whale doesn't have bigger cells
than a hummingbird, just a lot more of them. Cells have to do a lot of stuff to stay alive. And they need energy to be able to do so. To get this energy, animal cells convert food
and oxygen into usable chemical energy. This happens in our mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell. They're like little coal engines
that spit out tiny ATP batteries, which the cell can use for almost
everything it needs to do. Just like an engine, mitochondria get
really hot while working. In human skin cells, they reach a scorching 50 degrees Celsius. And some of our cells
have up to 2,000 mitochondria which are radiating their heat into the cell. So, being alive generates a lot of heat. The more cells you have, the more heat
your body generates in total. If our bodies didn't
find ways of losing this heat, we would be cooked from the inside and die. But this is a problem for bigger animals because of the way bodies change as
living beings scale up. Animals have 3 properties
here that are important. Their length, their outsides or skin, and their insides, like organs, bones, and hopes and dreams. The thing that's hard to wrap your
head around is that when things grow, their insides grow faster than their outsides. Imagine a fleshy cube. If you double the length of its sides, its surface and volume do not double. In fact, the surface is now 4 times
the original size, and the volume of the cube
8 times the original size. Which is called the Square Cube Law, and has been annoying nature
for billions of years. So why is this a problem for big animals? Because heat can only leave
an object via its surface. So if we make our mouse
the size of an elephant, or 60 times longer, it has 3,600 times more surface
from which to lose heat. But it has 216,000 times more volume filled with trillions
and trillions of new hot mitochondria that produce more heat. A lot more insides; not that much more skin. Our mouse is very dead, very fast. But big things like elephants exist. So how do they deal with the heat? For one, they evolved ways to get rid of
energy more easily like huge flat ears, that have a lot of surface
where heat can escape. But that's not enough. Nature's solution is actually very elegant. Elephant cells are much, much
slower than mice cells. The bigger an animal is,
the less active its cells are. If we classify animals, by their
metabolic rates, and compare that to their overall mass,
It's clearly visible. It's not 100% accurate, but it is a good rule of thumb. Elephants are huge meat sacks filled with trillions and trillions of little coal ovens. So, they keep the ovens just active
enough to keep them running and never at full power. Their whole metabolism is slow. Things move at a nice chill pace. Small animals need to go
the exact opposite way. If you're small, you
have a lot of surface area compared to not a lot of volume. You don't have a lot of cell ovens and lose the heat
they produce very fast. So very tiny mammals came up with
a very extreme solution. Meet the Etruscan Shrew,
the smallest mammal on Earth. A mole-like thing that's more closely
related to hedgehogs than to mice. With the body length of 4 centimeters, it only weighs about 1.8 grams - as much as a paperclip. It's a tiny ridiculous being. It would basically cool off immediately, so its cells run on overdrive to stay warm. Its tiny ovens are filled at maximum capacity. Its heart beats up to 1,200 times a minute, and it breathes up to 800 times a minute. This creates an extreme need for energy. So the shrew has to eat constantly. After only 4 hours without food, it starves to death. And while an African elephant consumes around 4% of its body weight
in food each day. Our shrew needs 200% of its body weight in food a day just to survive. Imagine having to eat
2,000 Big Macs a day more than one a minute. Fun for a while, but then not so much. So, a cubic centimetre of shrew
needs 40 times more food than a cubic centimetre of elephant. If an elephant's cells suddenly become as active as
the cells of a shrew a crazy amount of heat
would be generated. All the liquids in the elephant
would suddenly start boiling. And then it would explode in an impressive explosion of steaming
hot burning elephant parts. In reality, before an explosion occurred the proteins making up
our cells would probably be denatured, and stop producing heat. But a meat explosion is much more fun than melting an elephant
into a massive hot goo. Regardless, the scaling of the speed of 
metabolism happens everywhere. Even in places we don't expect,
like pregnant women. A baby in the womb of its mother behaves
as if it were a part of her. Its cells have about
the same metabolic rate, the same speed of life, 
as its mother's organs. It is truly a part of a bigger whole,
rather than an individual. Until it's not anymore. The very moment a baby is born,
a switch is flipped and all its internal
processes speed up rapidly. 36 hours after birth, the baby's cells have the same activity
rate as a mammal its size. Babies literally transition
from being an organ to being an individual, in mere hours. But there's one thing where big and small things
are very similar: Heartbeats. Mammals tend to have a similar
amount of heartbeats, over their lifetime. Typically around 1 billion. So, while the shrew and elephant
are very different, they share a similar number of heartbeats
over the course of their lives. Their speed of life is the opposite
and somehow still the same. And, for a video in which we made elephants
explode for no good reason. This is the most romantic ending
we could come up with."
kl39KHS07Xc,2017-12-07T14:08:08.000000,Universal Basic Income Explained – Free Money for Everybody? UBI,"What if the state covered your cost of living, would you still go to work? Go back to school? Not work at all? What would you do? This concept is called a universal basic income or UBI And it's nothing less than the most ambitious social policy of our times in 2017, basic income is gaining momentum around the world First trials are ongoing or on their way and a growing number of countries are considering UBI as an alternative to welfare How would it work and what are the key arguments for and against? Right now people can't really agree. What universal basic income is or should be Some want to use it to eliminate welfare and Cupp bureaucracy Others want it as a free extra for existing programs, or even want it to be so high that work itself becomes optional For this video we'll talk mostly about the minimum basic income enough money to be above the poverty line in the US this means about $1,000 a month or $12,000 a year The money would not be taxed and you could do whatever you wanted with it in In this scenario UBI is a way of transferring the wealth of a society while still keeping the free market intact But if we hand out free money will people just spend it on booze and stop working? A 2013 study by the World Bank specifically examined if poor people waste their handouts on tobacco and alcohol if they receive it in the form of cash The clear answer, no they don't. The opposite is true Other studies have shown that the richer you are, the more drugs and alcohol you consume The lazy and drunk poor person is a stereotype rather than reality What about laziness? Universal basic income test runs done in Canada in the 1970s showed that around 1% of the recipients stopped working, mostly to take care of their kids On average people reduced their working hours by less than 10% The extra time was used to achieve goals like going back to school or looking for better jobs But if laziness and drugs are not a huge deal, Why doesn't our current welfare state solve poverty Welfare or unemployment programs often come with a lot of strings attached Like taking part in courses, Applying to a certain number of jobs a month or accepting any kind of job offer no matter if it's a good fit, or what it pays Besides the loss of personal freedom, these conditions are often a huge waste of time and only served to make the unemployment statistics Seem less bad Often your time would be much better spent looking for the right job continuing education or starting a business Another unwanted side effect of many welfare programs is that they trap people in poverty and promote passive behavior Imagine a benefit of $1,000 each month in a lot of programs if you earn a single dollar extra the whole thing is taken away If you take a job, that's paying $1200 you might not only lose your benefits, but because of your taxes and another costs like transportation You might end up having less money than before So if you actively try to better your situation, and your total income is not improving or even a shrinking welfare can create a ceiling that traps people in poverty and rewards passive behavior A basic income can never be cut and  therefore getting a job and additional income would always make your financial situation better Work is always rewarded instead of a ceiling it creates a floor from which people can lift themselves up But even if UBI is the better model, is it economically feasible? What about inflation? Won't prices just rise making everything just like it was before? Since the money is not being created by magic or printers it needs to be transferred from somewhere It's more of a shift of funds than the creation of new ones Hence; no inflation Ok, but how do we pay for it? There's no right answer here because the world is too diverse How well-off the country is, what the local values are, Are things like high taxes or cutting the defence budget politically acceptable or not? How much welfare state is already in place and is it effective? Each country has its own individual path to a UBI The easiest way to pay for a UBI is to end all welfare and use the free funds to finance it Not only would this make a number of government agencies disappear, which in itself saves money, it would also eliminate a lot of bureaucracy on the other hand cutting them could leave many people worse off than before If the goal is to have a foundation for everybody there still need to be programs of some sort because just like countries, People are not the same The second way - higher taxes especially for the very wealthy In the US for example there's been a lot of economic growth but most of the benefits from it have gone to the richest few percent the wealth gap is rapidly widening and many argue that it might be time to distribute the spoils more evenly to preserve the social peace There could be taxes on financial transactions, capital, land value, carbon, or even robots But UBI is not necessarily expensive According to a recent study a UBI of $1,000 per month in the US Could actually grow the GDP by 12% over eight years because it would enable poor people to spend more and increase overall demand What about the people who do the dirty work? Who will work in the fields, crawl through sewers, or lift pianos? If you don't need to for survival, will people still do hard boring and unfulfilling labor? UBI might give them enough leverage to demand better pay and working conditions a study calculated that every extra dollar going to wage earners would add about $1.21 to the national economy While every extra dollar going to high-income Americans would add only 39 cents There would still be very rich and poor people but we could eliminate fear, suffering, and existential panic for a significant part of the population Making poor citizens better off could be a smart economic tactic For some this isn't enough. They want a UBI large enough to live a middle-class existence If we set the financial obstacle aside, this idea fundamentally challenges, how our society is constructed By earning money, you earn the possibility to take part in society this determines your status and options But it also forces many people into spending huge chunks of their time on things they don't care about in 2016 only 33% of US employees were engaged at work 16% were actively miserable and the remaining 51% were only physically present Would 67% of people stop working if they could? It would be unfair to portray work as just a chore work gives us something to do. It challenges us it motivates us to improve, it forces us to engage Many find friends or partners at work, we work for social status wealth and our place in the world We're looking for something to do with our lives and for many people work gives them meaning There are other concerns with UBI If all welfare programs were exchanged for one single payment, this gives the government a lot of leverage individual programs are easier to attack or cut than a multitude or populist smite promise drastic changes to the UBI to get into power and a universal basic income doesn't tackle all problems when it comes to equality Rents for example while $1,000 might be great in the countryside, it's not a lot for expensive metropolitan areas which could lead to poor people moving outwards and the difference between rich and poor becoming even more extreme and of course, for some people, the concept of work itself not being essential for survival is appalling Conclusion So is the universal basic income a good idea? The honest answer is that we don't know yet There needs to be a lot more research more and bigger test runs We need to think about what kind of UBI we want and what we're prepared to give up to pay for it The potential is huge. It might be the most promising model to sustainably eliminate poverty It might seriously reduce the amount of desperation in the world and make us all much less stressed out This video was made possible by a Universal basic income provided by you, our viewers Ten thousand people around the world gift us a monthly income on patreon.com/Kurzgesagt You enable us to pay salaries and buy new hardware you enable us to make more videos And you enable us to spend more time on them Kurzgesagt would truly not be what it is today without your help You help us stay independent, and you give us the freedom to put quality before quantity Thank you so much"
16W7c0mb-rE,2017-11-16T15:01:58.000000,Emergence – How Stupid Things Become Smart Together,"An ant is pretty stupid. It doesn't have much of a brain, no will, no plan, and yet, many ants together are smart. An ant colony can construct complex structures. Some colonies keep farms of fungi, others take care of cattle. They can wage war or defend themselves. How is this possible? How can a bunch of stupid things do smart things together? This phenomenon is called emergence, and it's one of the most fascinating and mysterious features of our universe. In a nutshell, it describes small things forming bigger things that have different properties than the sum of their parts. Emergence is complexity arising from simplicity, and emergence is everywhere. [Intro] Water has vastly different properties to the molecules that make it up, like the concept of wetness. Take wet fabric, If you zoom in far enough, there is no wetness. There are just molecules sitting in the spaces between the atoms of the cloth. Wetness is an emerging property of water. Something new only created by a lot of individual interactions between water molecules. And this is sort of it. Many things interact under a certain set of rules, creating something above and beyond themselves. It turns out that more is different. This different property is itself a new thing, and that new thing can couple with other new things to repeat the process. You can imagine this as layers stacked upon each other every, layer made from more complex parts. Atoms form molecules. Molecules form proteins. Proteins make up cells. Cells make up organs. Organs form individuals. Individuals form societies. But how can something be more than the sum of its parts? How do ants form the sort of cloudy entity that is a colony? By following a ruleset that produces order through chaos. For example, let's look at how an ant colony distributes jobs. Let's assume that a colony shall have 25% workers, 25% caretakers, 25% soldiers and 25% gatherers. Ants communicate their current job via chemicals. For example, the worker ant constantly secretes chemicals that say: ""I'm a worker"". When ants meet other ants, they smell each other to gather information, telling each other their job and what they're doing. Both keep track of who they met in the past. Now, imagine an anteater kills most of the gatherers. If this isn't fixed quickly, the colony will starve. Many worker ants need to switch jobs, but how do you tell this to thousands of them? Simple. You don't. Our worker ant will still meet and smell other ants, but it will encounter almost no gatherers at all. It counts too few gatherers, until it reaches a critical point, and then it changes its job. The worker becomes a gatherer. Other ants will do the same, until after a while there are enough gatherers again. The balance is restored all by itself. The actions and interactions of an individual are random. You can't plan which ant will encounter which other ant. But the simple set of rules is so elegant that a colony's many operations emerge as a consequence. On an even more fundamental level, hundreds of millions of complicated molecules interact to maintain a robust and amazing structure. A being with vastly different properties than the sum of its dead parts emerges. The smallest unit of life: a cell. We still don't have a clear definition of what living things are, we just know they emerge from things that are not alive. Cells combine and cooperate. They specialize and respond to one another, and over time, we develop into complex organisms with remarkable capacities. Your arms and legs and heart are an incredibly complex and complicated system made of trillions of individual stupid things... ...and yet we breathe, digest and watch YouTube videos. How do your cells know what to do? Think of the pacemaker cells in your heart. Billions of them need to send out an impulse just at the right moment to collectively create a heartbeat. Our cells exchange chemical information with their neighbor cells to see what they're up to, and then decide what to do. If it's among a lot of cells that are working on the same task, it will start working on that task as well, and sync up with them. There is no master mind giving commands. Just single units communicating with their neighbors, and acting according to the feedback they get. What about our most important part? What is the thing that asks these kinds of questions? Is our consciousness then an emergent property of the cells in our brain? This question is too big and important, it deserves a video of its own. Some things that emerge are hard to define. You can't touch an ant colony, only its parts. It has neither brain nor face, nor body. And yet the colony interacts with the world. Just like colonies emerge from ants, things emerge from humans, like Nations. What actually is a nation, is it its population? Is it its institutions, its symbols like its flag, colours or anthems? The physical things it makes like cities, the territory it occupies? All of these things are fluid. Populations change and are replaced. Institutions come and go, cities can be constructed and abandoned. Borders have changed all the time for most of history, and symbols get replaced by new symbols. A nation has no face, no brain, no body. Are nations not real, then? Of course they are, just like ant colonies, nations interact with the world. They can change landscapes, wage wars, grow or decline, and they can stop existing. But they only exist because of a lot of humans interacting with each other. But not just nations. All the complex structures that surround us emerge from us. Even if we don't intend to, we are constantly creating. Communities, companies, cities, societies. All of these things are entities that have fundamentally different properties and abilities than the pretty stupid apes they emerged from. We don't know why any of this happens. We just observe it, and it seems to be a fundamental property of our universe. It may be the most beautiful and wonderous property of our universe. [Outro]"
MjdpR-TY6QU,2017-11-03T13:33:42.000000,How to Cure Aging – During Your Lifetime?,"Health is the most valuable thing we have in life, but we tend to forget that until we lose it. We're living longer than ever before, which is great, but an unforeseen consequence of this is that we also spend a larger and larger portion of our lives being sick. Getting old currently means spending more time in pain. So scientists are trying to shift the attention of the medical community from optimizing lifespans to optimizing healthspans, the part of our lives during which we're disease free. To do this, we need to attack the root cause of almost all bodily defects: aging itself. Unbeknown to most people, the science of aging has made enormous progress In the last few years, with human trials about to begin in the near future. Let's look at three examples of discoveries that might benefit people who are alive right now INTRO 1: senescent cells. Your cells have an expiration date. Each time one of your cells divides, it copies its chromosomes. Because of the way this works, they lose a tiny bit of DNA at the ends. This could be catastrophic, so to protect themselves we have long segments of DNA called telomeres that sort of act like the stiff bits at the end of shoelaces, but they shrink with every cell division. In some cells, after a number of divisions the telomeres are gone, and the cell becomes a zombie, a senescent cell. Senescent cells stay around and don't die. The older you get the more of them are inside you. They harmed tissue around them and are linked to many diseases that accompany old age like diabetes and kidney failure. But what if you could kill them off? Scientists genetically engineered mice so that they could destroy their senescent cells as they pleased. Older mice without senescent cells were more active. Their hearts and kidneys worked better, and they were less prone to cancer. Overall, they lived up to 30 percent longer and in better health than average mice. Since we can't genetically engineer all the cells in the human body, we need to find another way to get rid of our senescent cells. But how do we kill them without harming healthy cells? Most cells in the body commit a programmed cell suicide when they're damaged, but senescent cells don't. It turns out that they underproduce a protein that tells them when it's time to die. So in a late 2016 study, mice were given an injection of this protein. It killed 80 % of all their senescent cells, while causing almost no harm to healthy cells. The treated mice became generally healthier and even regrew lost hair. As a result, there are a number of new companies looking at treatments involving senescent cells and the first human trials will start soon. 2: NAD+ Cells are made of hundreds of millions of parts. They're the structures, machines, messages, and the catalysts that make reactions happen. All these parts constantly need to be destroyed, cleaned up, and rebuilt. As we age, this process becomes less effective and so parts become crumpled, bunched up, or are removed slower, or they are no longer produced in the quantities we need. One of these parts is NAD+, a coenzyme that tells ourselves to look after themselves. At age 50, we only have about half as much in our bodies as we do at age 20. Low amounts of it are linked to a whole bunch of diseases from skin cancer to Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. But NAD+ can't enter cells so we can't get it as a pill. But scientists notice that other more flexible substances could enter cells and would then turn into an NAD+ inside. In 2016, multiple trials on mice showed that they boosted the multiplication of skin, brain, and muscle stem cells. They were rejuvenated, had a higher ability to repair their DNA, and had a slightly increased lifespan, This even got NASA interested, which is looking for a way to minimize the DNA damage astronauts would be exposed to from cosmic radiation on Mars missions. There are human trials being planned right now, but it's too soon to say if this will boost our healthspan or even lifespan. But NAD+ is a serious candidate and could become the first human anti-aging pill. 3: stem cells Stem cells are like cell blueprints that sit at various places in the body and copy themselves to produce a steady flow of fresh young cells, but they decline as we age and so we decline too. Without new parts, human bodies break. In mice, scientists observed that as the stem cells in their brains disappeared, they started to develop diseases So they took stem cells from baby mice brains and injected them directly into the brains of middle-aged mice, more specifically the hypothalamus, a polyp that's involved in regulating a lot of bodily functions. The fresh stem cells reinvigorated older brain cells by secreting micro RNAs that regulated their metabolism. After 4 months, brain and muscles worked better than those of untreated mice and on average, they lived ten percent longer. Another study took stem cells from mice embryos and injected them directly into the hearts of older mice. As a consequence, they had improved heart function, could exercise 20% longer, and weirdly enough their hair regrew faster. Conclusion What all of this tells us is that there is not a single magic bullet with which to cure aging. It requires a complex array of different therapies. We can kill off senescent cells to clear away the junk, give ourselves fresh new stem cells to fill the gap, all while regulating the metabolism of the other cells using medication. This video comes with a big caveat. After all, these studies have been carried out on mice. There's no guarantee the same therapies would work in us to the same extent, but they are proof of concepts. To learn more about how we can modify our own healthspan, we need human trials. We've only covered a tiny part of the research that's being done right now, and only scratched the surface of these ideas. The field of healthspan extension needs more attention and funding. If it gets it, all of us might enjoy growing old without pain If you now want to support the research on aging directly, you can do so at lifespan.io, a community of people actively supporting the scientists working to cure aging.

GoJsr4IwCm4,2017-10-20T13:01:59.000000,Why Age? Should We End Aging Forever?,"If you had to choose right now, how long would you want to live? 80 years? 90? 120? Longer? And do you think you'll change your mind once you reach that age? Fifty thousand years ago most humans died very young. As we learned how to use the resources around us to treat ourselves, this got better and better. Today, humans are living longer and healthier lives than ever before. But this has an unforeseen consequence. We spend an ever-increasing part of our lives being sick and in need of care. Most of us will die in a hospital bed, which is depressing enough by itself. But we also have to witness the same happening to our loved ones. Except, maybe we can stop this forever. The most effective way to treat a disease is to prevent it. It saves many more lives if you stop a million people from smoking, than coming up with better chemotherapies. So why not put a halt to the cause of all disease: the process of aging. In a nutshell, aging is caused by physics, and not biology. Think of cars. Parts wear down from rubbing and grinding. Metal rusts. Filters get plugged. Rubber cracks. Our bodies are worn down by trillions of tiny physical processes. Oxygen, radiation from the sun, our metabolism. Our bodies have many mechanisms to repair this damage, but over time they become less effective. So our bones and muscles weaken. Our skin wrinkles. Our immune system gets weaker. We lose our memory and our senses diminish. There's no such thing as dying of old age. We all die because one of our important parts breaks. The older we get, the more damaged and fragile we become until one or multiple diseases take over and kill us. Unnoticed by most of us, longevity research has made some unprecedented advances in the last few years. For the first time, we're starting to understand the mechanisms behind aging and how to manipulate them. Aging is neither mystical nor inevitable, and we might be able to stop or delay it during your lifetime. We'll discuss the science behind it and how scientists are trying to stop it in another video. But first, if we could, should we end aging? Is this a good idea? The end of aging or life extension makes many people uncomfortable. We're born, are young, become older, and then we die. This has been the natural order for literally all of human history, and getting old is a good thing, right? We celebrate the idea of living long enough to experience old age. We even call them the golden years. But the reality is that everybody wants to become old, but nobody wants to be old. Think of the Greek myth of Tithonus for example. Tithonus was the lover of the goddess Eos and probably an amazing dude, because she begged Zeus to grant him immortality, so they could spend eternity together. But she forgot to specifically ask for eternal youth. Tithonus was granted eternal life, but he kept aging, unable to die. After a few hundred years, he was reduced to the size of a grape, babbling on senselessly forever. Thousands of years ago, humans already feared never-ending old age. But ending aging does not mean getting weaker and weaker. If you become too old, it's too late. A 90 year old who stopped aging would die anyway after a few years. Too much damage has been done to his internal machinery. There are already too many surfaces for disease to attack. Instead, the concept of life extension promises to end diseases, and with them, the end of a fixed maximum age. We don't know how much we could prolong our lives. We might make every human healthy to the currently accepted maximum age of around 120, or we might stop biological aging and disease indefinitely. Nobody knows at this point what's possible. Okay, but even if we could achieve that, should we? Well, life extension is really just another phrase for medicine. All the doctors are doing is trying to prolong life, and minimize suffering. The vast majority of healthcare resources are spent on the consequences of aging. Nearly half of your lifetime healthcare costs will be spent during your senior years, and another third during middle age. We are actually already trying to prolong life with our current medicine. We're just doing it very inefficiently. Trying to stop aging from happening is not less natural than transplanting a heart, treating cancer with chemotherapy, using antibiotics or vaccines. Nothing humans do nowadays is purely natural anymore, and we enjoy the highest standard of living ever as a consequence of that. What we're doing right now is waiting until it's too late and the machine is failing. And then we use the vast majority of our resources trying to fix it as well as we can, while it breaks down even further. But life extension still feels hubristic. Most people assume that they will want to die once they reach a certain age, and this might still be true. The idea of avoiding death entirely is off-putting for many. The end of biological aging would not be in the end of death in any way. It's more like a summer evening when you were a kid, and your mom called you inside. You just wanted to keep playing, have a little more fun during sunset before you went to sleep. It's not about playing outside forever, just a little longer, until we feel tired. If you imagine a world without disease where you and your loved ones could live in good health for another 100 or 200 years, how would this change us? Would we take better care of our planet if we knew we would be around longer? If we could work for 150 years, how much time would we spend figuring out what we're good at? How much more time would we spend learning? Would the intense feeling of pressure and stress many of us are feeling right now, go away or get worse? So asking again, if you could choose how long to live right now, in good health and with your friends and family, what's your personal answer? What would you like your future to look like? CGP Grey: But maybe you're still unconvinced. Some nagging feeling remains. That is the Reaper whispering into your brain. Watch my video to hear what he says, and why you shouldn't listen.

and there is nothing we can do about it So, millions of years ago we made a pact, we give them shelter and food, and in turn they work for us. But the more we learn about this partnership,
the more it looks like a cold war Inside our mother's womb,
humans start out sterile When we are born and traveling
through the birth canal, billions of our mother's bacteria cover
every single part of our bodies. This is an essential part of human health. Children born via C-section have a
higher rate of asthma, immune diseases and even leukemia. So our bodies do not only accept the invasion
of microorganisms, they welcome it. Over millions of years, we co-evolved to
make the best of our relationship. Mother's milk for example, contains special sugars that are
meant to feed and support certain groups of microbes, work as a decoy for others, and help to modulate the 
immune system. It takes up to two years, until a healthy
microbe community has formed. Every human has their own unique microbiome,
made up of bacteria, viruses, fungi and other organisms. We have three categories of guests,
on and in our bodies. One: Quiet passengers that do their own thing,
and are politely ignored. By being there, they take up space and keep
more aggressive intruders in check. Two: Guests that harm us, But with whom we've learned to live, for example, bacteria that literally create 
acid that melts our teeth, if we don't brush enough. They want to take up as much
space as they can, and we don't want them to. But, we can't get rid of them entirely. Three: Friendly fellows that our bodies
want to have around, most of them are a community of
380,000 billion bacteria, from up to 5,000 different species,
that live in our gut. These gut microorganisms help us digest food, and pull additional calories from things
that we can't digest ourselves. Unfortunately, our gut is also the
perfect point of attack for intruders, so it's guarded by an aggressive army, our immune system. To survive here, our microbiome
co-evolved with us to be able to communicate
with our body. The most important part of that is to ask
the immune system to not kill them. But, they also have a real motivation
to keep our gut healthy, so some of them produce a
messenger substances, that help to educate the immune system, and others stimulate the gut cells
to regenerate faster. But, over the last few years. Evidence has emerged that the
influence of our gut microbiome, goes much much further. It might even talk directly to our brain. We've observed a few curious things, 90% of our body's serotonin, an important messenger substance
for nerve cells, is produced in the gut. Some scientists think the
microbiome does this, to communicate with the vagus nerve. The information highway of our nervous system. Other examples are bacteria that
stimulate immune cells in the gut, so they send a kind of alarm
signal to the brain. Here, it activates immune cells that help
the brain recover from injuries. Since the brain decides what we eat, the microbiome is interested
in a healthy brain. A new field of science is
opening up here, and we're just on the verge of
understanding how these complex systems inside our bodies interact. But we are starting to see how
much our microbiome actually influences us and our behavior. Take depression for example, Healthy rats fed microbes from the 
guts of depressed people, began showing anxiety-like behavior, and symptoms that look like depression. And in early 2017, a study linked the
microbiome to intelligence, by connecting a certain set up
of bacteria in newborns, with better motor and language skills. But it might also influence our daily lives. Tests with fruit flies, showed that their microbiome, influenced
what kinds of food they craved. This could mean your microbes are
able to tell your brain, which food it should get them. Although, this is not a one-way street The seed for our microbiome
comes from our mother, but how it develops and changes, is
determined by what we eat. the organisms in our gut feed
on different things, some like fibers and leafy greens, others go for sugars and starches, and some love greasy fries and butter. Our gut is like a garden in which
we constantly decide, what will grow and blossom. If we eat healthily, we breed bacteria
that like healthy food. If we eat a lot of fast food, then we
breed fast food loving bacteria. Life is hard, so we can get trapped
in a vicious circle. You have a stressful time, and eat lots
of burgers and fries and pizza. This is awesome for fast food bacteria, they multiply and multiply, and take up space
from vegetable loving bacteria. But even worse, they send signals to the
brain to continue what it's doing. this makes you want more
fast food. Which breeds more fast
food bacteria, which makes you crave fast food,
and so on. This kind of self-reinforcing cycle, could play a huge role in obesity. But, it's important to stress that you
can fight this process, and reverse it, by eating healthily and
breeding more good bacteria. Beyond weight gain, our microbiome
has also been linked to other serious diseases like autism, schizophrenia, and cancer. One of the earliest symptoms of Parkinson's,
is actually gut problems. If your body is overrun with
bacteria that harm you, there is often only one solution. You bring in an army of good guys. That's very easy, You just transplant some healthy poop. You do that by literally transferring poop,
from a healthy person, into your gut. This method is already used,
to cure diarrhea that's caused when C. difficile bacteria,
take over a gut microbiome. But we just don't know enough about
the complex interplay at work here yet. For example, a transplant from an overweight
donor cured a woman's diarrhea, but contributed to her obesity down the line. This caused some ways and another
study tried to reverse the effect. Poop transplants from slim people
to obese ones, gave them a more diverse microbiome, and made them less sensitive to insulin. Both things that also happen when
people lose weight We need to do a lot more science,
to really understand how our microbes make us
healthy or sick. But, whether we like it or not. We need our microbiome, and it needs us. We'll never have our bodies to ourselves. But we have gained a powerful ally, if we can just keep the peace."
tlTKTTt47WE,2017-09-21T12:33:24.000000,Is Reality Real? The Simulation Argument,"We humans are unable  to experience the
true nature of the universe, unfiltered. Our senses and brains can only
process a fraction of the world. So we have to use concepts and tools, to
learn about the true nature of reality Technological progress not only widened
our knowledge about the universe, it also made us aware of unsettling possibilities. In the future, it might become possible
to simulate entire universes. But if this is an option, how can we know
that it's not already happened? What if we are not creators, but creations? Is it possible that we are not real,
and we don't even know it? If our current understanding of physics is correct, Then, it's impossible to simulate the whole universe,
with its trillions and trillions of things. But we don't actually need to, anyway. We only need enough universe to fool
the inhabitants of our simulation, into thinking that they're real. Who needs billions of galaxies? We only need the space our
subjects are allowed to explore. The vast universe could just be a flat projection, and they would have no way to know. What about small things like cells or bacteria? We don't really need them. When you use a microscope, what you
see could be instantly created. Same with atoms the chair you're sitting
on right now does not need to be simulated with quadrillions of atoms. We just need the outermost layer of it, it might be empty inside, until you
decide to break it open. Your body might feel like it's filled with bubbly things,
but it might be empty, until you open it. The minimum requirement for our simulation,
is only the consciousness of our virtual humans. Our subjects just need to think the simulation is real. Okay, so are we being simulated? Well, maybe, but there are a few
conditions that need to be met. Obviously, we have no authority over this topic,
so please take everything we say with a grain of salt. Based on a modified version of the original
simulation argument by Nick Bostrom, we have five assumptions for you. If they're true, you dear viewer are living in a simulation. Assumption one, it's possible to simulate consciousness Nobody knows what consciousness is. For the sake of argument, let's assume that you could generate consciousness by simulating a brain. Brains are pretty complex. If you count every interaction between
synapses as one operation, your brain runs at about ten to the power of seventeen, for one hundred million billion operations, per second. Let's generously assume we need ten
to the power of twenty operations, to simulate one second of human consciousness. But, we don't want to simulate just one human... We want to simulate all of human history at once,
so we can skip around. Let's say we want to simulate two hundred billion humans, with an average life span of fifty years. One year has thirty million seconds times fifty years times two hundred billion humans times ten to the power of twenty operations. So we need a computer able to handle million,
trillion, trillion, trillion operations per second. More operations than there are stars
in the observable universe. The computer like this is just impossible. Except, maybe it isn't. Assumption two, technological progress will not stop anytime soon. If we assume that technological progress continues
in a similar fashion as it has so far, then there might be galaxy spanning civilizations,
with unlimited computer power at some point. Beings on a technology level so advanced, that we
could barely distinguish them from god's. A computer that can handle a million trillion, trillion, trillion operations is serious business, but there are actually concepts for computers,
which could handle this. The Matrioshka Brain, is the theoretical megastructure, made up of billions of parts orbiting a star,
feeding on its radiation. A computer of this scale, would have enough
power to simulate many thousands, if not millions of humanities, at the same time. Other technologies, like high-end future quantum computers might lower the size drastically, so it might be possible to do this with a structure the size of a large city, or even smaller. But, only if there's still someone around
to build the computer. Assumption three, advanced civilizations don't destroy themselves. If there is a point at which all civilizations destroyed themselves, this whole discussion ends here. Looking into space, you'd expect to universe filled,
with millions of alien civilizations, but we see nobody. the reason for this might be, Great Filters. Great Filters are barriers life has to overcome,
like nuclear war, asteroids, climate change or a black hole generator. If life is inherently self-destructive,
then there are no simulations. We explain this in more detail, in our 
Fermi Paradox video. Assumption four, super advanced civilizations, want to run simulations. When we speak of posthuman civilizations,
we don't know what we're dealing with To think we know what beings as powerful
as gods want, is pretty arrogant. Imagine the smartest ant on earth living
next to an amusement park, It's curious about what humans are up to, 
so you try to explain. Unfortunately, the ant just doesn't understand. The concept of rollercoasters and standing
in lines and holidays and fun, doesn't make sense to an ant living an ant life. It's the same with us and a posthuman being, compared to them, we are ants. Running simulations for fun or science,
might be an absurdly stupid idea to them. But, if they do want to run simulations for whatever reasons and assumptions one, two, three are true too, then the chances are not zero that you
are living inside a simulation. Assumption five, if there are a lot of simulations, you are
probably inside a simulation. if there are simulated civilizations,
It's likely that there are a lot of them. After all, we assume that post human beings have access to practically unlimited computing power. So if they run simulations, it would be convenient
to run millions or even billions of them. If there are billions of simulated universes, there are probably trillions and trillions of simulated conscious beings. which would mean that the vast majority of all conscious beings that will ever have existed, are simulated. So, for every conscious being made of flesh,
a billion simulated ones exists. Since we have no way of knowing if we are simulated or not, in this case, the chances of you being one
of the nine hundred and ninety nine million nine hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine simulated ones, are pretty high. So, what you consider reality, might not be real at all You really might be... simulated. All of this is based on a lot of assumptions
that we can't really test right now So many scientists disagree with
this whole thought experiment. So don't burn your house down to test 
if there will be glitches. If you are simulated, not that much changes for you you might be on a small planet speeding
through eternal nothingness, or a simulation inside a computer. your existence does not become
more or less scary and bizarre. All we can hope to do is try to live good lives,
and have a good time. And hope that if we actually are simulations
in a supercomputer, nobody trips over the power cable. Oh, oh, oh no, I think I just unplugged the simulation But what if that doesn't matter, what if we are in one right now? What if you are simulated? Jake, over at Vsauce3 is looking into that. Click here to watch his video and
subscribe to his channel. Why are you still here? go over to Vsauce3 watch the video and subscribe, we promise, it's worth your time..."
J0ldO87Pprc,2017-09-07T12:30:00.000000,What Happens If We Bring the Sun to Earth?,"What would happen if you were to bring 
a tiny piece of the Sun to Earth? Short answer: you die.
Long answer: it depends which piece of the Sun. Like most of the matter in the universe, 
our Sun is neither solid, liquid or gas, but plasma. Plasma is when stuff is so hot that the nuclei and electrons can separate and flow around freely,
which creates a goo like substance. So, you can imagine our Sun as an extremely big, spherical ocean of very hot goo. The deeper you, go the denser and weirder the goo becomes. So let's bring 3 samples (each the size of a house), 
to our lab here on Earth and see what happens. First sample: 
the chromosphere. The chromosphere is the atmosphere of the Sun, 
a layer of sparse gas up to 5,000 kilometers deep, that's covered in a forest of plasma spikes that can be almost as big as Earth. It's pretty hot here between 6,000 and 20,000 degrees Celsius, but if we brought a solvent of it to Earth, we're not really getting our money's worth. Where we take our sample, the chromosphere is over a million times less dense than air. So, compared to our atmosphere at sea level,
it's basically the same as bringing the vacuum of space down to Earth. The moment our sample arrives, it would immediately be crushed by Earth's atmospheric pressure and implode. Air would rush to fill the vacuum and use as much energy as 12 kilograms of TNT in the process. This creates a high pressure shockwave, which shatters glass, ruptures ear drums, and maybe some internal organs. If you're standing too close it could kill you, so you'd better keep your distance Let's go deeper. Second sample, the photosphere Beneath the chromosphere, is the glowing surface of the Sun: the photosphere, which produces the light we see. It's covered in a grid of a million hot spots called granules. Each of them about as big as the United States, and over 5,000 degrees Celsius. These granules are the tops of convective columns, churning gas that brings the heat up from the center of the Sun to its surface. In these columns, a few hundred kilometres down, we take our second plasma sample. It has about the same pressure as our atmosphere on earth Though still much less dense for there. Its heat supports it, so it won't implode. Our sphere now carries twice as much energy, as much as 25 kilograms of TNT, that this time as heat. For a dazzling instant, this plasma would glow with a million times the brightness of the Sun seen from Earth, instantly lighting fires throughout our lab, but a few milliseconds later. Those fires are all that's left. The plasma has cooled to harmless gas, floating up from the flaming ruins. What if we go deeper? Third sample. The radiative zone. Here, the plasma is about two million degrees Celsius, and so dense and tightly packed, that it creates a sort of maze for itself. Energy in the form of photons tries to escape, but has to wander for hundreds of thousands of years, bouncing endlessly from particle to particle, until it eventually finds an exit. Bringing matter from here to our lab, is what experts call, a very bad idea. As soon as it arrives in our lab, the extreme pressure that holds the plasma tightly together is gone, and the material explodes with the power of a thermonuclear weapon. Our lab as well as the city around it will be destroyed in an instant. On the bright side, there won't be any radioactive fallout. With our lab destroyed, we can abandon the illusion that we're trying to do any science today. What if we go much, much deeper? Last sample. The core Here in the central 1% of the star, we find a third of the sun's mass. The matter here is compressed by the weight of the entire star above it. In the center of the core, the temperature is 15 million degrees, hot enough to make helium by smashing together hydrogen, powering the Sun by nuclear fusion. In billions of years after the death of the Sun, this core will remain as a white dwarf. If we brought a sample of it to Earth, it would cause a lot of inconvenience The biggest nuclear weapon ever detonated, had an energy of 40 megatons of TNT, or a cube the size of the Empire State Building. Our sample has the equivalent of 4,000 megatons. This is four billion tons of TNT, or a cube 1.3 kilometers high. To give you a sense of scale this is the cube inside Manhattan. Once the sphere arrives on Earth, this super dense matter expands instantly and creates an explosion with the force of well, the Sun. If we get the sample in Paris, in the morning the citizens of London would see what looks like a second sunrise. But, one that gets brighter and brighter, and hotter and hotter, until London burns to ashes. In a radius of about 300 kilometres around the blast, everything would be burnt. The shockwave would travel around the Earth multiple times. Most buildings in Central Europe would be flattened, eardrums would rupture, and windows break across the continent. The explosion would be apocalyptic. possibly humans civilization ending. If humans did survive, we could count on the dust blown into the atmosphere to create a small ice age. So, if there is one tiny bright side, it would be that the explosion might be an effective way to control human-caused climate change for a few decades. While this is definitely a good thing, all in all we conclude, that we should not try to bring the Sun to earth"
yWO-cvGETRQ,2017-08-24T12:44:22.000000,Why Black Holes Could Delete The Universe – The Information Paradox,"Black holes are the most powerful things in the universe, strong enough to rip whole stars into atom sized pieces Well, this is scary enough. They have an even more powerful and dark property: they might delete the universe itself. Black holes in a nutshell A black hole appears when an extraordinary amount of matter is concentrated in a tiny space. At their center, gravity is almost infinitely strong and whatever gets too close is ripped into its elementary particles. Not even light can escape black holes, and so we perceive them as spheres of blackness. If you were to fall into a black hole, nothing bad would happen until well after you crossed its outer border: the event horizon. You can imagine this as swimming in a river that ends in an enormous waterfall. As you float along, imperceptibly, the stream gets faster and faster, even if you can't see the waterfall yet. You could swim to safety, until without even noticing it, you cross the point of no return. No matter how fast you try to swim now, the stream will pull you towards certain death. Nothing can escape a black hole waterfall once it gets too close. This border completely separates black holes from the rest of the universe: we can't access them unless we're willing to never return. So there's no way of telling what's really going on inside black holes, but we have a few ideas about what's going on right at their very edges. Black holes radiate their mass away, like a hot pot on a stove losing its water as steam. This is called Hawking radiation. Black holes constantly lose an extremely tiny amount of their mass, a process that's unbelievably slow. It will take a black hole with a mass of our sun 10,000 billion billion billion billion billion billion years to lose 0.0000001% of its mass. This is happening constantly and unstoppably, and as it goes on it speeds up more and more. In the far far future when the last star in the universe has been dead for trillions of years, black holes will become tinier and tinier until they evaporate and disappear, leaving behind just a bit of radiation. But this is a problem, because in the process of disappearing black holes might delete something fundamental: information. 2 - What is information? Information is nothing tangible. It's typically understood as a property of the arrangement of particles. What does this mean? Imagine a bunch of carbon atoms. Arrange them in a certain way and you get coal. Arrange them in a different way, and you get a diamond. The atoms are the same, what changes is the information. If we make this more complex and add in a few more atoms, we get a banana. Change the arrangement of the atoms, and we get a squirrel. The basic building blocks of everything in the universe are the same, and don't care if they're part of a bird or a rock or a cup of coffee. Without information everything in the universe would be the same. According to the theory of quantum mechanics information is indestructible. It might change shape, but it can never be lost: for example if you burn a piece of paper, you get ash. That ash will never become paper again. But, if you were able to carefully collect every single carbon atom in the ash, and measured the exact properties of the smoke and heat radiating from the fire, you could, in theory reconstruct the paper. The information of the paper is still in the universe. It's not lost, it's just hard to read. If you could somehow measure every single atom and particle and wave of radiation in the universe, you could see and track every bit of information there is. Hypothetically, you could see the entire history of the universe right back to the Big Bang. And here black holes trip us up. Information tells us how things are different from each other and what used to be what. Black holes do the opposite: they take different things and make them the same. They destroy information. This creates the information paradox, and this is a serious problem. The information paradox It's fundamental for all our laws of physics that information can never be lost. Existing, not existing. Without information, everything is relative. When it comes to our understanding of reality, we need absolutes. How could we solve this paradox? There are a few possibilities. 1) Information is lost. Irretrievably and forever. This means we have to nix all our laws of physics, throwing out a lot of stuff that's worked very well so far and to start from scratch What those new laws of physics would look like, or what that means for us, nobody knows. This is a little frightening, but also kind of exciting. 2) Information is hidden. Maybe a little part of the black hole splits off and forms a baby universe. The information would be transferred into this new weird place, where we could never observe or interact with it, but technically it would not be lost. It's like having a broken hard drive with all your family photos, that you could never access. Sure, it's nice that they've not been deleted, but also not very helpful. Or maybe black holes don't disappear completely after the end of their life cycles, but a little piece is left, an information diamond. like a clown car filled with an infinite amount of information clowns. But there's a third option: Information is safe after all, not lost or hidden. Perhaps we've just been looking at this whole thing the wrong way. We know that black holes trap information and might delete it later, but we never thought about what they do with it in the meantime. Where do black holes store their information? Cosmic housekeeping Let's create a black hole with dirty laundry. First, we fill up a room with laundry baskets: the more laundry you want to store, the more baskets you put in the room. But at some point every single basket is full, and the room is completely stacked, not a single extra sock fits in. The room is at maximum capacity. But if we still squeeze the sock in with a lot of energy and violence, the room collapses in on itself and forms a black hole. But the capacity of the room itself has not changed, fitting in more stuff or information is still impossible. So what happens if we throw more laundry into it? The room itself gets a little bit bigger to make space for the new information. It turns out a black hole grows its surface by a tiny pixel for each bit of information we throw into it. In a nutshell, more information means more surface area. The information gets painted on the surface, similar to what happens when we throw a stone into a pond. After the stone sinks to the bottom we can't see it anymore, but we can tell that something went in from the ripples on the surface of the pond. Even the smallest black hole can store more information on its surface than all the data ever produced in human history. They do this by storing information in a type of pixel that is unbelievably tiny. Black holes are the ultimate hard drive. This is a bit like taking a paper back, and turning it into an e-book, two things that look completely different. But their content is the same -- it's just encoded and memorized in another way. Black holes swallowing stars and planets is a bit like transferring a whole library onto an e-reader. This solution is called the holographic principle, but if it's correct then everything we thought we knew about the universe is wrong. The universe is a hologram If information is actually stored on the boundary of a black hole, the Hawking radiation has a chance of learning about the information encoded there, and can carry it away. So, information is not lost when black holes fade away, and we do not need to redo physics: the information paradox is resolved. But we still have to change our understanding of reality in a fundamental way. If everything that falls into the black hole is stored on its event horizon, that basically means that three-dimensional stuff is encoded on a flat surface. We have a name for this: a hologram. A hologram is like a 3D photo, a flat piece of plastic that encodes a three-dimensional image. A black hole is like a hologram, because everything inside it is encoded on its event horizon. A person inside a black hole will experience their usual three-dimensional life. but for us on the outside they are flattened images on the surface of the black hole. The consequence of this is counterintuitive, but stay with us for a moment. Black holes are very extreme objects, but they're still bound to the same rules as everything else. So if this crazy duality between 2D and 3D works for black holes, then it might work for the whole universe, and you in it. Since a person inside a black hole would not realize that they're encoded on a flat surface, we might share the same fate: you really might be stretched over a flat screen at the end of the universe. The science behind this is complicated and really weird, with toy universes to play with, string theory and a lot of maths. We'll talk about this more in another video. Regardless of what the true nature of the universe really is, we just know that it's strange and complicated, and we have to do a lot more physics to understand it. But black holes might be key to understanding the nature of reality itself. This video was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, and realized with the scientific advice of Alessandro Sfondrini."
f7KSfjv4Oq0,2017-08-10T12:07:40.000000,What Happens If We Throw an Elephant From a Skyscraper? Life & Size 1,"Let's start this video by throwing a
mouse, a dog, and an elephant from a skyscraper onto something soft. Let's say, a stack of mattresses. The mouse lands and is stunned for a moment, before it shakes itself off, and walks away pretty annoyed, because that's a very rude thing to do. The dog breaks all of its bones and dies in an unspectacular way, and the elephant explodes into a red puddle of bones and insides and has no chance to
be annoyed. Why does the mouse survive, but the elephant and dog don't? The answer is size. Size is the most underappreciated 
regulator of living things. Size determines everything about our biology, how we are built, how we
experience the world, how we live and die. It does so because the physical laws are
different for different sized animals. Life spans seven orders of magnitude,
from invisible bacteria to mites, ants, mice, dogs, humans, elephants and, blue
whales. Every size lives in its own unique universe right next to each other,
each with its own rules, upsides, and downsides. We'll explore these different
worlds in a series of videos. Let's get back to the initial question: Why did our
mouse survive the fall? Because of how scaling size changes everything; a principle that we'll meet over and over again. Very small things, for example,
are practically immune to falling from great heights because the smaller you
are the less you care about the effect of gravity.
Imagine a theoretical spherical animal the size of a marble. It has three
features: its length, its surface area, (which is covered in skin) and its volume,
or all the stuff inside it like organs, muscles, hopes and dreams. If we make it
ten times longer, say the size of a basketball, the rest of its features
don't just grow ten times. Its skin will grow 100 times and it's inside (so it's
volume) grows by 1000 times. The volume determines the weight, or more accurately,
mass of the animal. The more mass you have, the higher your kinetic energy
before you hit the ground and the stronger the impact shock. The more
surface area in relation to your volume or mass you have, the more the impact
gets distributed and softened, and also the more air resistance will slow you
down. An elephant is so big that it has extremely little surface area in ratio
to its volume. So a lot of kinetic energy gets distributed over a small space and
the air doesn't slow it down much at all. That's why it's completely destroyed in
an impressive explosion of goo when it hits the ground. The other extreme,
insects, have a huge surface area in relation to their tiny mass so you can
literally throw an ant from an airplane and it will not be seriously harmed. But
while falling is irrelevant in the small world there are other forces for the
harmless for us but extremely dangerous for small beings. Like surface tension
which turns water into a potentially deadly substance for insects. How does it
work? Water has the tendency to stick to itself; its molecules are attracted to
each other through a force called cohesion which creates a tension on its
surface that you can imagine as a sort of invisible skin. For us this skin is so
weak that we don't even notice it normally. If you get wet about 800 grams
of water or about one percent of your body weight sticks to you. A wet mouse
has about 3 grams of water sticking to it, which is more than 10% of its body
weight. Imagine having eight full water bottle sticking to you when you leave
the shower. But for an insect the force of water surface tension is so strong
that getting wet is a question of life and death.
If we were to shrink you to the size of an ant and you touch water it would be
like you were reaching into glue. It would quickly engulf you, its surface
tension too hard for you to break and you'd drown. So insects evolved to be water
repellent. For one their exoskeleton is covered with a thin layer of wax just
like a car. This makes their surface at least partly water repellent because it
can't stick to it very well. Many insects are also covered with tiny hairs that
serve as a barrier. They vastly increase their surface area and prevent the
droplets from touching their exoskeleton and make it easier to get rid of
droplets. To make use of surface tension evolution cracked nanotechnology
billions of years before us. Some insects have evolved a surface covered by a
short and extremely dense coat of water repelling hair. Some have more than a
million hairs per square millimeter when the insect dives under water air stays
inside their fur and forms a coat of air. Water can't enter it because their hairs are
too tiny to break its surface tension. But it gets even better, as the oxygen of
the air bubble runs out, new oxygen diffuses into the bubble from the water
around, it while the carbon dioxide diffuses outwards into the water. And so
the insect carries its own outside lung around and can basically breathe
underwater thanks to surface tension. This is the same principle that enables
pond skaters to walk on water by the way, tiny anti-water hairs. The smaller you get
the weirder the environment becomes. At some point even air becomes more and
more solid. Let's now zoom down to the smallest insects known, about half the size
of a grain of salt, only 0.15 millimeters long: the Fairy Fly.
They live in a world even weirder than another insects. For them air itself
is like thin jello, a syrup-like mass surrounding them at all times.
Movement through it is not easy. Flying on this level is not like elegant
gliding; they have to kind of grab and hold onto air. So their wings look like
big hairy arms rather than proper insect wings. They literally swim through the
air, like a tiny gross alien through syrup.
Things only become stranger from here on as we explore more diversity of
different sizes. The physical rules are so different for each size that
evolution had to engineer around them over and over as life grew in size in
the last billion years. So why are there no ants the size of horses?
Why are no elephants the size of amoeba? Why? We'll discuss this in the next part. We have a monthly newsletter now, sign up if you don't want to miss new videos and

MBRqu0YOH14,2017-07-26T12:16:28.000000,Optimistic Nihilism,"Human existence is scary and confusing. A few hundred thousand years ago, we became conscious and found ourselves in a strange place. It was filled with other beings. We could eat some; some could eat us. There was liquid stuff we could drink; things we could use to make more things. The daytime sky had a tiny yellow ball that warmed our skin. The night sky was filled with beautiful lights. This place was obviously made for us. Something was watching over us. We were home. This made everything much less scary and confusing. But the older we got, the more we learned about the world and ourselves. We learned that the twinkling lights are not shining beautifully for us, they just are. We learned that we're not at the center of what we now call the universe, and that it is much, much older than we thought. We learned that we're made of many little dead things, which make up bigger things that are not dead, for some reason, and that we're just another temporary stage in a history going back over a billion years. We learned, in awe, that we live on a moist speck of dust moving around a medium-sized star in a quiet region of one arm of an average galaxy, which is part of a galaxy group that we will never leave. And this group is only one of thousands that, together, make up a galaxy supercluster. But even our supercluster is only one in thousands that make up what we call the observable universe. The universe might be a million times bigger, but we will never know. We can throw words around like two hundred million galaxies or trillions of stars or bazillions of planets, but all of these numbers mean nothing. Our brains can't comprehend these concepts. The universe is too big. There is too much of it. But size is not the most troubling concept we have to deal with. It's time, or, more precisely, the time we have. If you're lucky enough to live to one hundred, you have five thousand two hundred weeks at your disposal. If you're twenty-five now, then you have three thousand nine hundred weeks left. If you're going to die at seventy, then there are two thousand three hundred and forty weeks left - a lot of time, but also ... not really. And then what? Your biological processes will break down, and the dynamic pattern that is you will stop beinge dynamic. It will dissolve until there is no you left. Some believe that there is a part of us we can't see or measure, but we have no way to find out, so this life might be it and we might end up dead forever. This is less scary than it sounds, though. If you don't remember the 13.75 billion years that went by before you existed, Then the trillions and trillions and trillions of years that come after will pass in no time once you're gone. Close your eyes. Count to 1. That's how long forever feels. And as far as we know, in the end, the universe itself will die and nothing will ever change again. Our videos induce existential dread in many people, and the last few minutes probably haven't helped. So, for once, we want to offer a different way of looking at these things: an unscientific, subjective point of view, the philosophy of Kurzgesagt, if you want. Please take it with a grain of salt; we don't know any more about human existence than you do. We counter existential dread with optimistic nihilism. What do we mean by that? Well, to summarize, it seems very unlikely that 200 trillion trillion stars have been made for us. In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us. We became self-aware only to realize this story is not about us. While it is great to know about electrons and the powerhouse of the cell, Science doesn't do a lot to make this less depressing. Okay, but so what? You only get one shot at life, which is scary, but it also sets you free. If the universe ends in heat death, every humiliation you suffer in your life will be forgotten. Every mistake you made will not matter in the end. Every bad thing you did will be voided. If our life is all we get to experience, then it's the only thing that matters. If the universe has no principles, the only principles relevant are the ones we decide on. If the universe has no purpose, then we get to dictate what its purpose is. Humans will most certainly cease to exist at some point, but before we do, we get to explore ourselves and the world around us. We get to experience feelings. We get to experience food, books, sunrises, and being with each other. The fact that we're even able to think about these things is already kind of incredible. It's easy to think of ourselves as separated from everything, but this is not true. We are as much the universe as a neutron star or a black hole or a nebula. Even better, actually, we are its thinking and feeling part: the centre organs of the universe. We are truly free in a universe-sized playground, so we might as well aim to be happy and to build some kind of utopia in the stars. It's not as if we've found out everything there is to know We don't know why the rules of the universe are as they are, how life came into existence, what life is. We have no idea what consciousness is or if we are alone in the universe. But we can try to find some answers. There are billions of stars to visit, diseases to cure, people to help, happy feelings to be experienced, and video games to finish. There is so much to do. So, wrapping up, you've probably used up a good chunk of the time available to you. If this is our one shot at life, there is no reason not to have fun and live as happy as possible. Bonus points if you made the life of other people better. More bonus points if you help build a galactic human empire. Do the things that make you feel good. You get to decide whatever this means for you."
WSKi8HfcxEk,2017-06-08T16:28:31.000000,The Rise of the Machines – Why Automation is Different this Time,"How long do
you think it will take before machines do your
job better than you do? Automation used to mean big stupid machines
doing repetitive work in factories. Today they can land aircraft,
diagnose cancer and trade stocks. We are entering a new age of automation
unlike anything that's come before. According to a 2013 study,
almost half of all jobs in the US could potentially be automated
in the next two decades. But wait; Hasn't automation
been around for decades? What's different this time? Things used to be simple. Innovation made human work
easier and productivity rose. Which means that more staff
or services could be produced per hour using the same
amount of human workers. This eliminated many jobs, but also
created other jobs that were better which was important because the
growing population needed work. So, in a nutshell, innovation,
higher productivity, fewer old jobs, and many
new and often better jobs. Overall, this worked well for a majority
of people and living standards improved. There's a clear progression in
terms of what humans did for a living. For the longest time,
we worked in agriculture. With the Industrial Revolution, this
shift into production jobs and as automation became more widespread,
humans shifted into service jobs. And then only a few moments ago in human
history, the Information Age happened. Suddenly, the rules were different.
Our jobs are now being taken over by machines much faster
than they were in the past. That's worrying of course... but
innovation will clearly save us, right? While new information age
industries are booming, they are creating fewer
and fewer new jobs. In 1979, General Motors
employed more than 800,000 workers and made about
$11 billion US dollars. In 2012, Google made about $14 billion US
dollars while employing 58,000 people. You may not like this
comparison, but Google is an example of what created
new jobs in the past: Innovative new industries. Old innovative industries are running
out of steam. Just look at cars. When they became a thing 100 years
ago, they created huge industries. Cars transformed our way of life,
our infrastructure, and our cities. Millions of people found jobs
either directly or indirectly. Decades of investment
kept this momentum going. Today, this process is largely complete.
Innovation in the car industry does not create
as many jobs as it used to. While electric cars are great and all,
they won't create millions of new jobs. But wait; what about the internet? Some technologists argue
that the Internet is an innovation on a par of the
introduction of electricity. If we go with this
comparison, we see how our modern innovation differs
from the old one. The Internet created
new industries, but they're not creating
enough jobs to keep up with population growth or to compensate for
the industries the Internet is killing. At its peak in 2004, Blockbuster had 84,000 employees and
made $6 billion US dollars in revenue. In 2016, Netflix had 4,500 employees and
made $9 billion dollars in revenue. Or take us, for example. With a full-time team of just 12 people,
Kurzgesagt reaches millions of people. A TV station with the same amount
of viewers needs way more employees. Innovation in the Information
Age doesn't equate to the creation of enough new
jobs, which would be bad enough on its own but now, a
new wave of automation and a new generation of machines
is slowly taking over. To understand this, we need to
understand ourselves first. Human progress is based
on the division of labor. As we advanced over thousands of years,
our jobs became more and more specialized. While even our smartest machines
are bad at doing complicated jobs, they are extremely good at doing narrowly defined and predictable tasks. This is what destroyed factory jobs. But look at a complex job
long and hard enough, and you'll find that it's
really just many narrowly defined and predictable
tasks one after another. Machines are on the brink
of becoming so good at breaking down complex jobs
into many predictable ones, that for a lot of people, there will be
no further room to specialize. We are on the verge of being outcompeted. Digital machines do this
via machine learning, which enables them to acquire
information and skills by analyzing data. This makes them become better at something
through the relationships they discover. Machines teach themselves. We make this possible by
giving a computer a lot of data about the thing we
wanted to become better at. Show a machine
all the things you bought online, and it will slowly learn what to recommend
to you, so you buy more things. Machine learning is now meeting more
of its potential because in recent years, humans have started to
gather data about everything. Behavior, weather patterns, medical
records, communication systems, travel data, and of course,
data about what we do at work. What we've created by accident
is a huge library machines can use to learn how humans do things
and learn to do them better. These digital machines might
be the biggest job killer of all. They can be replicated
instantly and for free. When they improve, you
don't need to invest in big metal things; you can
just use the new code. And they have the ability to
get better fast. How fast? If your work involves complex work on
a computer today, you might be out of work even sooner than the people
who still have jobs in factories. There are actual real-world examples of
how this transition might be happening. A San Francisco company offers a
project management software for big corporations, which is supposed to
eliminate middle management positions. When it's hired for a new project, the
software first decides which jobs can be automated and precisely where
it needs actual professional humans. It then helps assemble a team of
freelancers over the Internet. The software then distributes tasks to
the humans, and controls the quality of the work, tracking individual
performance until the project is complete. Okay. This doesn't sound too bad. While this machine is killing one job,
it creates jobs for freelancers, right? Well, as the freelancers
complete their tasks, learning algorithms track
them, and gather data about their work, and which
tasks it consists of. So what's actually happening, is that the freelancers are teaching
a machine how to replace them. On average, this software
reduces costs by about 50% in the first year, and by
another 25% in the second year. This is only one example of many. There are machines and
programs getting as good or better than humans
in all kinds of fields. From pharmacists to analysts,
journalists to radiologists, cashiers to bank tellers, or the
unskilled worker flipping burgers. All of these jobs won't
disappear overnight, but fewer and fewer humans
will be doing them. We'll discuss a few cases
in a follow-up video. But while jobs disappearing is
bad, it's only half of the story. It's not enough to
substitute old jobs with new ones. We need to be generating
new jobs constantly because the world
population is growing. In the past we have solved
this through innovation. But, since 1973, the generation of new
jobs in the US has begun to shrink. And the first decade of the 21st
century, was the first one, where the total amount of jobs in the US,
did not grow for the first time. In a country that needs to create
up to 150,000 new jobs per month, just to keep up with
population growth, this is bad news. This is also starting to
affect standards of living. In the past, it was seen as
obvious that with rising productivity, more and better
jobs would be created. But the numbers
tell a different story. In 1998, US workers worked
a total of 194 billion hours. Over the course of the next 15 years,
their output increased by 42 percent. But in 2013, the amount of hours worked
by US workers was still 194 billion hours. What this means, is that
despite productivity growing drastically, thousands of new
businesses opening up, and the US population growing by over
40 million, there was no growth at all in the number
of hours worked in 15 years. At the same time, wages for
new university graduates in the US, have been declining
for the past decade, while up to 40 percent of
new graduates, are forced to take on jobs that
don't require a degree. Productivity is separating
from human labor. The nature of innovation
in the Information Age is different from everything
we've encountered before. This process started years ago
and is already well underway. Even without new disruptions like
self-driving cars, or robot accountants. It looks like
automation is different this time. This time, the machines
might really take our jobs. Our economies are based on
the premise that people consume. But if fewer and fewer people have decent
work, who will be doing all the consuming? Are we producing ever more cheaply
only to arrive at a point where too few people can actually buy
all our stuff and services? Or, will the future see a tiny minority of
the super rich who own the machines... dominating the rest of us? And does our future
really have to be that grim? While we were fairly dark
in this video, it's far from certain that things
will turn out negatively. The Information Age and modern
automation, could be a huge opportunity to change human society, and reduce
poverty and inequality drastically. It could be a seminal
moment in human history. We'll talk about this potential,
and possible solutions like a universal basic income, in
part 2 of this video series. We need to think big, and fast. Because one thing's for
sure, the machines are not coming; They are already here."
qsN1LglrX9s,2017-05-04T12:17:32.000000,The Last Light Before Eternal Darkness – White Dwarfs & Black Dwarfs,"Humans can survive in this universe as long as we have an energy source. Unfortunately, the universe will die. It will happen slowly, over many billions of years, but it will happen. On a universal time scale, stars like our sun will be gone in no time. Luckily, there are places that will exist practically forever from a human perspective: the corpses of dead stars... white dwarfs. They could be humanity's last home right before the death of the universe. What are these strange things and what happens when they finally die? How long stars live varies drastically, depending on how massive they are. For example, really massive stars burn hot and fast, dying violently in supernovae a few million years after birth. But they're the exception. 97% of all stars will end their existence as white dwarfs. There are two ways this can happen: Small stars - so-called red dwarfs - burn out over trillions of years until they eventually quietly turn into white dwarfs. Medium-sized stars like our Sun are more interesting. Imagine the sun as a huge pressure cooker that fuses hydrogen into helium in its core through its gravity. The fusion of elements releases extreme amounts of energy, that pushes outwards and stabilizes the star, keeping it in a delicate balance. When the Sun is old, the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, and the Sun will begin to burn helium into heavier elements. While doing so, it will shed its outer layers. When this process is over more than half of the Sun's mass will be lost into space as a spectacular planetary nebula millions of kilometers across. What remains will be its former core: A white dwarf is born, a star corpse. While its former self was about 100 times its diameter, now it's only about as big as Earth, but still with about half of its former mass. This means it's extremely dense, a teaspoon of white dwarf is about as massive as a car. Its surface gravity is over 100,000 times higher than Earth's. If you tried to land on it, you'd immediately be compressed into a steaming puddle. Life around a white dwarf is very unlikely, but possible. Most of them that exist now were former stars that, well, died, which probably ruined any planets they once had. But that's not all: since they are so small, a planet would need to orbit them about 75 times closer than Earth is to the Sun to have liquid water. This proximity has up- and downsides: for one, it would tidally lock the planet giving it a permanent day and permanent night. At the edges of these day and night zones life could be possible. But white dwarfs have a very stable energy output, so they might actually be safer to live around than many red dwarfs. This is still speculation at this point, but if we could find the white dwarf with the right conditions to settle around, we could have a home for many billions of years. But why do they shine so much longer than other star types? White dwarfs are very, very hot - up to 40 times hotter than our Sun - ranking among the hottest objects in the universe. But they are not incredibly active. All the heat inside of them is trapped and has nowhere to go. Only on its outer layer can it escape into space. But space is mostly empty, so heat can't be transferred by conduction. The only way energy can escape is by radiation. This is so inefficient that white dwarfs will take trillions of years to cool down, which may make them humanity's last refuge. They might be the last sources of light and energy in a dying universe. According to some estimates white dwarfs might shine as long as 100 billion billion years, ten billion times longer than the universe has existed. So far into the future that no regular stars will shine any more, galaxies will have evaporated, and only then will the first white dwarf turn into the first black dwarf. When this happens the last hope for life will die off. Black dwarfs will be inactive spheres with no energy left to give, still massive enough to kill you if you get too close. So cold that they'll be near the coldest possible temperature in the universe, so dark that they are practically invisible. The universe will enter its last stage - heat death - which will leave the universe unrecognizable, an absolutely dark and cold graveyard, with black holes and black dwarfs scattered over trillions of lightyears. We don't know for sure what will happen with black dwarfs in the end. If the proton - one of the fundamental parts of atoms - has a limited lifespan, black dwarfs will slowly evaporate over many trillions of years. If the proton does not decay, black dwarfs will probably turn into spheres of pure ion via quantum tunneling, over a timespan so obscenely gigantic that calling it forever is okay. These ion spheres will then travel completely alone through a dark universe. Nothing new will happen anymore... forever. While this may sound kind of dark, this is so far away that for our purposes today, it might as well not happen at all. It doesn't matter what happens in a billion trillion years. Right now, we happen to exist at an excellent time, able to be in awe about a universe filled with endless stars and light and planets. And enough time to visit them one day.

XxutY7ss1v4,2017-04-13T12:01:11.000000,Is the European Union Worth It Or Should We End It?,"Do you think the European Union is worth it? Or, should we end it? Many people feel a strong disconnect with the EU, while others praise its achievements. Everything considered: Is its existence good or bad for Europeans? Since it looks like the UK is leaving the EU, we'll mostly treat it as if it's no longer part of the club. The European Union, combining its 27 member countries, has a population of about 450 million people, making it the third most populous sort-of country in the world. It's the world's second largest economy by GDP, and has the biggest single market in the world. But originally, the creation of the European Union was all about one thing: Peace. Europeans are really good at war, so they were involved in bloody conflicts for basically all their history. A century-long rivalry between Germany and France alone, cost millions of lives and ran so deeply that Germans invented their own word for it: Erbfeindschaft. After the second World War, Europeans decided they wanted lasting peace that was not based on a balance of military power. Instead, the economies, politics, and peoples of Europe, should become so closely interconnected, that war would become both impractical and unthinkable. The plan worked! Between EU members, we've had over 70 years of peace. Okay, peace is great and all, but what are the European Union's achievements and problems? Today, EU citizens benefit from many individual freedoms. EU treaties and regulations ensure easy travel, cheap telecommunications, a great variety of goods and services, as well as very strong health and safety standards. European institutions are not afraid to pick a fight with companies such as Microsoft, Apple or Facebook about fair competition, tax evasion or data protection. Through the EU science programs, the European countries became a collaborative engine that serves as a hub of science in the wider world. Unrestricted travel and the right to work anywhere makes it easy to apply for funds, and set up international teams of experts with the best equipment. In turn, the EU became the world leader in terms of its global share of science researchers, and produces more than twenty-five percent of the world's research output, with only five percent of its population. But many citizens feel distrust toward the EU. Brussels seems far away and untransparent, technocratic, and difficult to understand. It doesn't help that the EU is terrible at outreach, and explaining what it actually does. This disconnect has also led to an ever-shrinking voter turnout over the decades. More transparency and accountability are desperately needed if the EU institutions want the trust of their citizens. Currently, the EU is still shaken by the refugee crisis of 2015. Some countries have accepted far greater numbers of asylum seekers than others, while the border countries are overwhelmed and feel left alone. Other countries are shocked by the initially unregulated mass immigration, and closed their borders, effectively shutting down the largest route into Europe. The EU's wealth and freedom make it an attractive destination, and this is unlikely to change. The population is split on how to react to that. Some argue that Europe let in too many immigrants, with a different culture without strictly demanding integration, while others argue that immigration is not the problem, but that racism and discrimination of immigrants is preventing integration. To strike a balance between helping refugees, turning illegal immigrants away, and successfully integrating the ones that stay, remains one of the most difficult and controversial challenges of the Union. Immigration aside,  many more challenges lie in the future, like defense. Traditionally, European countries have relied strongly on the protection of the US through NATO. But in the current political climate, Europe has to ask itself if it really wants to depend on the United States for its safety. If combined today, the militaries of EU members could form an effective defensive force and be the third largest military in the world. That could save a lot of money, safeguard European borders, and enhance cultural understanding with soldiers from 27 different countries serving one common purpose. What about money? Well, it's complicated. The EU created the largest single market in the world. Inside it, you can trade border and customs free. Countries that entered it got a massive boost to their economies. Even between neighbors, trade increased by up to five hundred percent, and there was a steady creation of new jobs. Research has suggested that joining the EU has left Most new members with an average of a twelve percent higher GDP than if they had remained outside. And for those regions with weaker economies and poor infrastructure, EU institutions provide billions of euros every year helping economic investment, infrastructure, and social development. On the negative side, the EU tries to hold together countries with vastly different economies and laws regarding labor, taxes and social security. The cost of one hour of work in an EU country ranges from four euros an hour to forty euros an hour. Some countries have large industries and strong exports while others focus on services, tourism, or natural resources. On top of this, the euro is the common currency of some but not all of these countries. As the Greek crisis shows, this can be a recipe for disaster. You cannot unify a vastly different economies under one currency, but their economic policies separate. So, should all EU countries unite under the common currency, or not? Should the weakest links be thrown out of the Euro, or should countries be made to adopt common policies on taxes, health care, and social security? It's a question that's been brewing for years, and is nowhere near a solution. So, everything briefly considered: Is the European Union worth it? Here is our answer: The EU is very flawed, and still needs a lot of work. But it's fair to say that the European Union makes Europeans powerful in the world. Put together, we lead in science, are one of the strongest economic powers, and could have one of the strongest militaries in the world. But more importantly, the EU gives us peace, security, and a sense of shared identity. And something we all crave in these turbulent times, stability. If we want to protect the values we're so proud of, a strong European Union is the best way to make sure our voice is heard in the world. Alone as small states, we'll hardly stand a chance in a world of shifting superpowers. What do you think about the EU in its future? In recent years, the discussion about political topics has become super toxic with sad real-world consequences. Let's not do that. If you don't agree with this video, you're not our enemy, you just have a different opinion and that's fine. We're all in the same boat after all, so let's have a fact-based discussion about our future."
7TmcXYp8xu4,2017-03-30T14:00:42.000000,Are GMOs Good or Bad? Genetic Engineering & Our Food,"GMOs are one of the most controversial areas of science. Genetic engineering is used in many fields, but even though medical applications like GM insulin are widely accepted, The debate heats up when it comes to food and agriculture. Why is that? Why is the same thing treated so differently? Let's try to get to the bottom of this and explore the facts, the fears, and the future of GMOs. Humans have been genetically modifing plants and animals for thousands of years. Maybe a few of your crops had very good yields. Maybe one of your wolves was especially loyal. So you did the smart thing, and bred the plants and animals that had traits beneficial to you. Traits suggest an expression of genes. So with each generation, those genes got more pronounced. After thousands of years, almost every single plant and animal around us is vastly different from its pre-domesticated state. If humans have been changing genes for millennia, what makes a so called ""Genetically Modified Organism"", or GMO, different? Selective breeding is basically hoping for lucky hits. Genetic engineering eliminates this factor. We can choose the traits we want. Make fruit grow bigger, immune to pests, and so on. So, why are people concerned about them ? Let's start with one of the most common objections to GMOs. Gene flow, meaning GM crops could mix with traditional crops and introduce unwanted new characteristics into them. There is a method that might guarantee complete prevention, but is a big anti-GMO argument by itself. Terminator seeds. The idea is that they could produce sterile plants, requiring farmers to buy new seeds every year. The very concept of this, however, caused a public outcry, stopping the technology being put to use. This brings us back to the unintentional spreading of engineered DNA. There have been cases of GMOs growing where they weren't planted, and traces of modified genes found in foreign crops. But GM plants can't run wild entirely. Many crops pollinate themselves, and all crops have to be related to mingle. There are also cultural methods like buffer zones, to keep unintentional crossing at a minimum. But if it's possible in principle that a GMO could unintentionally cross with a non-GMO, there's actually a more important question. Is food that comes from GM crops different to food from non-GM crops? This question has been a major concern from the very beginning. GM plants that are destined to be eaten are checked for possible dangers, and the results are evaluated by multiple agencies. After more than 30 years and thousands of studies, the science is in. Eating GMO plants is no more risky than their non-GMO equivalent. But don't just take it our word for it, the sources for this and other claims are in the video description. But what about plants that have been engineered to be toxic? For example, BT crops. A gene borrowed from the bacterium Bacillus Thuringiensis, lets engineered plants produce a protein that destroys the digestive system of specific insect pests. The plant makes its own pesticide. Insects that eat it die. That sounds alarming! Pesticide sprays could be washed off. While the poison in BT crops is inside the plant. But actually, it's not a big deal. Poison is really just a question of different perspectives. What's harmless to one species, might kill another. Coffee, for example, is a poison that kills insects but is harmless to us. Or take chocolate, it's dangerous for dogs but a pleasure for humans. BT crops produce a protein that is tailored to the specific design of the digestive tract of certain insects; it's completely harmless for us. There's also the opposite approach. Plants that are engineered to be resistant to certain weed killers. This way, farmers can use them widely, killing the other plants competing for resources without harming the crop. Here, we get to the dark underbelly of GMOs. For the pesticide industry, they are big business. Over 90% of all cash crops in the US are herbicide resistant, mostly to glyphosate. As a result, the use of glyphosate has increased greatly. That isn't only bad, glyphosate is much less harmful to humans than many other herbicides. Still, this means famers have a strong incentive to rely on this one method only, casting more balanced ways of managing weeds aside. That's one of the most fundamental problems with the GMO debate. Much of the criticism of this technology is actually criticism of modern agriculture and a business practice of the huge corporations that control our food supply. This criticism is not only valid, it's also important. We need to change agriculture to a more sustainable model. GMOs as a technology are actually an ally and not a enemy in that fight, helping to save and protect nature and minimize our impact on the environment. Let's look at some positive examples. Eggplant is an important crop in Bangladesh but often, whole harvests are destroyed by pests. Farmers had to rely heavily on pesticides. Not only was this very expensive, Farmers also frequently got sick. The introduction of a new GM eggplant in 2013 stopped this. The same BT protein we talked about before, an effective killer of insects but harmless to humans, was engineered into them. This reduced insecticide use on eggplants by more than 80%. The health of farmers improved, and their income rose dramatically. And sometimes, the GM approach is the only option. In the 1990s, the papaya industry in Hawaii was under attack from the ringspot virus which threatened to wipe out Hawaiian papaya. The solution was a papaya genetically modified to be vaccinated against the virus. Without it, the state's papaya industry would have collapsed. All these stories show a very narrow application. 99% of all GMOs we use right now produce pesticides, or are resistant against them. There is so much more we could do. The scientists are working on GMOs that could improve our diet. Plants that produce more or different nutrients, like fruit with higher antioxidant levels that help to fight diseases or rice with additional vitamins. On a larger scale, we're trying to engineer plants more resilient to climate change, plants that can better adapt to erratic weather and adverse soil conditions, making them resistant to droughts or floods. GMOs could also not only reduce agriculture's impact on the environment, but actively help to protect it. Scientists are working on crops that can draw nitrogen from the air, like microbes. Nitrogen is a common fertilizer, but its build-up pollutes the ground water and speeds up climate change. Plants that collect their own nitrogen could fix two problems at once. The over use of fertilizers in the developed world, as well as the shortage of it in developing countries. We could even modify plants to become super-effective carbon collectors,  like the American chestnut tree, to mitigate and actually reverse climate change. With the tools we have today, our imagination is the limit. The world eats 11 million pounds of food every day. A UN estimate suggests we'll need 70% more by 2050. We could grow that food by clearing more and more forests to create fields and pastures and by using more pesticides. Or we find a way to do it on the land we've got right now, with more effective methods like GM crops. Intensifying farming instead of expanding it means GMOs could become the new organic. In a nutshell, GMOs have the potential to not only drastically change agriculture but to also dampen the effects of our own irresponsible behavior. GMOs could be our most powerful weapon to save our biosphere. This video took more than 600 hours to make, which would be impossible without viewer support on Patreon.com.

DHyUYg8X31c,2017-02-23T13:31:05.000000,Do Robots Deserve Rights? What if Machines Become Conscious?,"Imagine a future where your toaster anticipates what kind of toast you want. During the day, it scans the Internet for new and exciting types of toast. Maybe it asks you about your day, and wants to chat about new achievements in toast technology. At what level would it become a person? At which point will you ask yourself if your toaster has feelings? If it did, would unplugging it be murder? And would you still own it?
Will we someday be forced to give our machines rights? AI is already all around you. It makes sure discounters are stocked with enough snacks, it serves you up just the right Internet ad, and you may have even read a new story written entirely by a machine. Right now we look at chat bots like Siri and laugh at their primitive simulated emotions, but it's likely that we will have to deal with beings that make it hard to draw the line between real and simulated humanity. Are there any machines in existence that deserve rights? Most likely, not yet.
But if they come, we are not prepared for it. Much of the philosophy of rights is ill-equipped to deal with the case of Artificial Intelligence. Most claims for right, with a human or animal, are centered around the question of consciousness. Unfortunately, nobody knows what consciousness is. Some think that it's immaterial, others say it's a state of matter, like gas or liquid. Regardless of the precise definition, we have an intuitive knowledge of consciousness because we experience it. We are aware of ourselves and our surroundings, and know what unconsciousness feels like. Some neuroscientists believe that any sufficiently advanced system can generate consciousness. So, if your toaster's hardware was powerful enough, it may become self-aware. If it does, would it deserve rights? Well, not so fast.
Would what we define as ""rights"" make sense to it? Consciousness entitles beings to have rights because it gives a being the ability to suffer. It means the ability to not only feel pain, but to be aware of it. Robots don't suffer, and they probably won't unless we programmed them to. Without pain or pleasure, there's no preference, and rights are meaningless. Our human rights are deeply tied to our own programming, for example we dislike pain because our brains evolved to keep us alive. To stop us from touching a hot fire, or to make us run away from predators. So we came up with rights that protect us from infringements that cause us pain. Even more abstract rights like freedom are rooted in the way our brains are wired to detect what is fair and unfair. Would a toaster that is unable to move, mind being locked in a cage? Would it mind being dismantled, if it had no fear of death? Would it mind being insulted, if it had no need for self-esteem? But what if we programmed the robot to feel pain and emotions? To prefer justice over injustice, pleasure over pain and be aware of it? Would that make them sufficiently human? Many technologists believe that an explosion in technology would occur, when Artificial Intelligence can learn and create their own Artificial Intelligences, even smarter than themselves. At this point, the question of how our robots are programmed will be largely out of our control. What if an Artificial Intelligence found it necessary to program the ability to feel pain, just as evolutionary biology found it necessary in most living creatures? Do robots deserve those rights? But maybe we should be less worried about the risk that super-intelligent robots pose to us, and more worried about the danger we pose to them. Our whole human identity is based on the idea of human exceptionalism, that we are special unique snowflakes, entitled to dominate the natural world. Humans have a history of denying that other beings are capable of suffering as they do. In the midst of the Scientific Revolution, René Descartes argued animals were mere automata―robots if you will. As such, injuring a rabbit was about as morally repugnant as punching a stuffed animal. And many of the greatest crimes against humanity were justified by their perpetrators on the grounds that the victims were more animal than civilized human. Even more problematic is that we have an economic interest in denying robot rights. If can coerce a sentient AI―possibly through programmed torture―into doing as we please, the economic potential is unlimited. We've done it before, after all. Violence has been used to force our fellow humans into working. And we've never had trouble coming up with ideological justifications. Slave owners argued that slavery benefited the slaves: it put a roof over their head and taught them Christianity. Men who were against women voting argued that it was in women's own interest to leave the hard decisions to men. Farmers argue that looking after animals and feeding them justifies their early death for our dietary preferences. If robots become sentient, there will be no shortage of arguments for those who say that they should remain without rights, especially from those who stand to profit from it. Artificial Intelligence raises serious questions about philosophical boundaries. What we may ask if sentient robots are conscious or deserving of rights, it forces us to pose basic questions like, what makes us human? What makes us deserving of rights? Regardless of what we think, the question might need to be resolved in the near future. What are we going to do if robots start demanding their own rights? What can robots demanding rights teach us about ourselves? Our friends at Wisecrack made a video exploring this very question using the philosophy of Westworld.

RVMZxH1TIIQ,2017-02-01T13:22:31.000000,Why Earth Is A Prison and How To Escape It,"We are prisoners on Earth. The Universe taunts us, by showing all the places we can't ever visit. However, if our species wants to have a long term future, we have to escape our prison. But what is keeping us here in the first place? Turns out, we owe the universe a debt that is 4.5 billion years old. *Intro* Everything with mass in the universe attracts every other thing with mass. We call this phenomenon 'gravity'. The closer you are to a big chunk of mass, the stronger the attraction or the more you're pulled in. This effect traps us on earth. We can imagine this as being prisoners in a gravity prison, or a gravity well. It's not a literal well, but a handy concept to understand how this works. Being in a gravity prison means that you owe gravity energy. But how can you owe energy? Because in our universe, things don't want to change their speed or direction. To convince them to move, you have to expend energy. Billions of years ago, the gravitational attraction of trillions of trillions of dust particles orbiting our sun caught them together until they formed a planet. This process used energy and created the gravity well we're now a part of. The deeper you are inside the gravity well, the more energy you owe gravity. If you don't find a way to get enough energy, then you aren't able to leave no matter what you do. Because your atoms were once part of the dust that the universe expended energy on to get to this place. Ok. Hmm...Let's summarise all of that again. Objects in the universe don't like to move. You have to convince them to do so with energy. Gravity used energy to convince the parts of our planet to move together. This created a gravity prison in the process, trapping us . To escape, it we need to repay it with energy. Ok. How do we do that? To get into space, we need to go through a complicated process of exchanging energy. For this purpose, we build a negative potential energy repaying machine. Known By their more boring name 'rockets' Rockets work by using some of the most energetic chemical reactions humans know about to basically explode fuel in a controlled way. This converts chemical energy into kinetic energy. The exhaust of the reaction is directed outwards, and pushes the rocket away from Earth. By expanding a lot of energy, we are increasing our gravitational potential energy. Which is a complicated way to say that we are paying back our energy debt to gravity. But it's actually a lot trickier than that. When you burn fuel to get into orbit, you lose lots of energy to heat, exhaust and atmospheric drag ,so you actually need much more. And you can't just pile a huge amount of radioactive, really explosive, dangerous fuel close to your payload and detonate it. You need a controlled burn which is complicated and makes your rocket very heavy ...which means it has more mass. The more mass something has, the more energy you need to convince it to move, so you need more fuel to lift up your rocket. But,if you need more fuel, that means you need more rocket to carry that fuel! But, this makes your rocket heavier thus requiring more fuel which requires more rocket to carry that new fuel and so on. At the end of this madness, you need closer to a 100x the weight of your payload to launch Ariane 6, for example (the european rocket) will weigh 800 tons and should be able to transport 10 tons into geostationary transfer orbit or, 20 tons into medium earth orbit. But a rocket can only produce so much thrust, so there is a maximum weight, after which it just won't take off. If you add too much weight, it won't lift off. So, you can't just build bigger and bigger fuel tanks This is the tyranny of the rocket equation and it means space flight will never become easy. But wait, it gets worse. Getting to space is still not good enough- you're still inside the gravity prison at the edge of space and will crash back to Earth. Staying in space is much harder than getting there. To get to a stable position, where it can stay for  a while, a rocket has to reach low Earth orbit. To do this, you need a lot of kinetic energy which means going extremely fast at an altitude of about 100 km, this is 8 km/s 28,000 km/h is fast enough to travel around Earth in 90 minutes. Here, we can use a trick. Instead of flying straight up, we can go sideways! Earth is a sphere. So, if you're going sideways, fast enough (even though you're falling towards Earth) the ground will curve away beneath you. So, as long as you're above the atmosphere (about 100 km up) you'll be able to stay up there in orbit. This is what the ISS does (falling around Earth, expending energy form time to time) to stay fast enough. If we look at orbits in scale, we see that near Earth orbit is laughably close to Earth. To deploy, for eg Satellites, on leave for other planets, requires another round of energy debt repayment. Getting to orbit is the most difficult part of space flight for us right now. For example: If we want to send a rocket to Mars, half the energy is necessary just to get into orbit and the other half for the 55 million km to Mars. Therefore, to be as effective as possible, rockets aren't built in one giant piece. Instead, we use multistage rockets. We don't need to carry an empty fuel tank, so rockets drop it. Rockets today, shed their boosters and main stage as they ascend with each successive stage being it's own fully contained rocket, complete with its own engine and fuel. Ok. So this is why getting to space is hard. If you feel all of this seems really complicated, don't worry. It's literally rocket science!

QsBT5EQt348,2016-12-22T13:38:26.000000,Overpopulation – The Human Explosion Explained,"Never before in history, have there been so many people on Earth as right now. Our numbers have skyrocketed, from 1 billion in 1800, to 2.3 billion in 1940, 3.7 billion in 1970, and 7.4 billion in 2016. The world population increased fourfold in the last century, so what can we expect for the next century? And what does population growth mean for our future? Will there be mass-migration? Overcrowded slums and megacities covering continents? Diseases and pollution? Chaos and violence over energy, water, and food? And a human species focused only on sustaining itself? Will population growth destroy our way of life? Or is this prophecy just ungrounded panic? In the 1960s population growth reached an unprecedented rate. Which lead to apocalyptic prophecies. The poor would pro-create endlessly and overrun the developed world. The legend of overpopulation was born. But it turns out high birth rates and the population explosion are not permanent features of some cultures or countries, But rather a part of a four step process the whole world is going through, The demographic transition. Most developed countries have already made the transition, while other countries are doing it right now. Let's go back to the 18th century, when the entire world, including Europe, was in the first stage of the demographic transition. By today's standards, Europe was worse off, than a developing region, suffering from poor sanitation, poor diets, and poor medicine. A lot of people were born, but lots of them died just as fast, so the population hardly grew. Women had between 4 and 6 children, but only 2 of them would reach adulthood. Then the industrial revolution happened in the UK and bought the greatest change in human living conditions since the agricultural revolution. People went from being peasants to workers. Manufactured goods were mass produced and became widely available. The sciences flourished and advanced transportation, communication, and medicine. The role of women in society shifted and created the conditions for their emancipation. Slowly this economic progress not only formed a middle class, but also raised standards of living and health care for the poor working population. The second transition stage started. Better food supplies, hygiene and medicine, meant people stopped dying all the time, especially so, at a very young age. The result was a population explosion. Doubling the UK's population between 1750 and 1850. The main reasons families used to have lots of children was that only a few of them were likely to survive. Now that had changed, so the third stage of transition was set in motion. Fewer babies were conceived, and population growth slowed down. Eventually a balance emerged, fewer people were dying and fewer children were born, so the death rate and birth rate became stable. Britain had reached the fourth stage of the demographic transition. This didn't only happen in the UK, more and more countries went through the four stages. First, many births and many deaths due to bad living conditions. Second, better living conditions leading to fewer deaths and a population explosion. Third, fewer deaths resulting in fewer births, and population growth came to an end. But if birth rates have dropped so much, why is the population still growing so fast? Well, the children born in the population explosion of the 70s and 80s are having kids themselves now. Leading to a noticeable spike in overall population. But they are having far fewer children on average than their parents. The average today is 2.5, it was 5, 40 years ago. So as this generation gets older, and fertility declines further, the rate of population growth will keep on slowing. This is true for every country. In the west, we tend to overlook progress in other regions of the world. But actually most of the world's countries have made it to the fourth stage. Just look at Bangladesh. In 1971, the average woman had 7 kids, but 25% of them would die before the age of 5. In 2015, the mortality rate was down to 3.8% and women had only 2.2 kids on average. This is the rule, not an exception, we're not special, we just had a head start. It took developed countries about 80 years to reduce fertility from more than 6 children, to less than 3. Others are catching up fast. Malaysia and South Africa did it in only 34 years; Bangladesh took just 20. Iran managed it in 10 years. All these countries that are catching up didn't have to start from scratch and the more support they get, the faster they catch up. This is why programs that help lower child mortality or help poor nations develop, are so important, No matter what your motivation is, whether you dream of a world where all people live in freedom and wealth, or you just want fewer refugees coming into your country, The simple truth is, that it's beneficial to you personally if people on the other side of the globe can live a good life. And we are getting there, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty has never been as low as today. So the future of global population growth is not an apocalyptic prophecy, it's a promise! Population growth will come to an end. The UN forecasts that the 12th billionth human will never be born at all. And as the development level of the world rises, the number of people a higher education will increase tenfold. Countries who used to be a need, will help advance development instead. More people is going to mean more people able to advance our species.

mZsaaturR6E,2016-11-10T17:26:44.000000,Fusion Power Explained – Future or Failure,"The fundamental currency of our universe is energy. It lights our homes, grows our food,
powers our computers. We can get it lots of ways: Burning fossil fuels, splitting atoms, or sunlight striking photovoltaics. But there's a downside to everything Fossil fuels are extremely toxic, Nuclear waste is... well, nuclear waste, And, there are not enough batteries to store sunlight for cloudy days yet. And yet the sun seems to have virtually limitless free energy. Is there a way we could build a sun on Earth? Can we bottle a star? [Intro Jingle] The sun shines because of nuclear fusion. In a nutshell, fusion is a thermonuclear process. Meaning that the ingredients have to be incredibly hot. So hot, that the atoms are stripped of their electrons Making a plasma where nuclei and electrons bounce around freely. Since nuclei are all positively charged, They repel each other. In order to overcome this repulsion, The particles have to be going very, very fast In this context, very fast means ""very hot"" Millions of degrees Stars cheat to reach these temperatures. They are so massive, that the pressure in their cores Generates the heat to squeeze the nuclei together Until they merge and fuse Creating heavier nuclei and releasing energy in the process. It is this energy release that scientists hope to harness In a new generation of power plant, The fusion reactor. On earth it's not feasible to use this brute force method to create fusion. So if we wanted to build a reactor that generates energy from fusion, We have to get clever. To date, scientists have invented two ways of making plasmas hot enough to fuse: The first type of reactor uses a magnetic field to Squeeze a plasma in a doughnut shaped chamber Where the reactions take place. These magnetic confinement reactors Such as the I.T.E.R. reactor in France, Use superconducting electromagnets cooled with liquid helium To within a few degrees of absolute zero. Meaning that they host some of the biggest temperature gradients in the known universe. The second type called ""Inertial confinement"" Uses pulses from super-powered lasers To heat the surface of a pellet of fuel Imploding it, briefly making the fuel hot and dense enough to fuse. In fact, one of the of the most powerful lasers in the world Is used for fusion experiments At the National Ignition Facility in the U.S. These experiments and others like them around the world are today, just experiments. Scientists are still developing the technology, And although they can achieve fusion, Right now, it costs more energy to do the experiment Then they produce in fusion. The technology has a long way to go before it's commercially viable, and maybe it never will be. It might just be impossible to make a viable fusion reactor on earth, But if it gets there, it will be so efficient That a single glass of sea water, could be used to produce as much energy as burning a barrel of oil, with no waste to speak of. This is because fusion reactors
would use hydrogen or helium as fuel And sea water is loaded with hydrogen But not just any hydrogen will do. Specific isotopes with extra neutrons called Deuterium and Tritium Are needed to make the right reactions. Deuterium is stable and can be found in abundance in sea water, Though Tritium is a bit trickier. It's radioactive And there may only be 20 kilograms of it in the world Mostly in nuclear warheads Which makes it incredibly expensive. So we made need another fusion buddy for Deuterium instead of Tritium. Helium-3, an isotope of Helium,
might be a great substitute. Unfortunately, it's also incredibly rare on earth. But here, the moon might have the answer. Over billions of years, the solar wind may have built up huge deposits Of Helium-3 on the moon. Instead of making Helium-3, we can mine it. If we could sift the lunar dust for helium, We'd have enough fuel to power the entire world for thousands of years. One more argument for establishing a moon base, if you weren't convinced already. Ok, maybe you think building a mini sun Still sound kind of dangerous But they'd actually be much safer
than most other types of powerplants A fusion reactor is not like a nuclear plant, Which can melt down catastrophically. If the confinement failed, then the plasma would expand and cool, And the reaction would stop. Put simply, it's not a bomb. The release of radioactive fuel, like Tritium, Could pose a threat to the environment. Tritium could bond with oxygen making radioactive water, Which could be dangerous as it seeps into the environment. Fortunately, there's no more than a few grams in use at a given time, So a leak would be quickly diluted. So we've just told you that theres nearly unlimited energy to be had At no expense to the environment In something as simple as water. So, whats the catch? Cost. We simply don't know if fusion power will ever be commercially viable. Even if they work, they might be too expensive to ever build. The main drawback, is that it's unproven technology Its a 10 billion dollar gamble And that money might be better
spent on other clean energy That's already proven itself. Maybe we should cut out losses Or maybe, when the payoff is unlimited
clean energy for everyone, It might be worth the risk.

ijFm6DxNVyI,2016-10-21T12:56:37.000000,The Most Efficient Way to Destroy the Universe – False Vacuum,"What if our universe comes with a self-destruct button to eliminate itself so cleanly and efficiently, that every single physical thing would just stop existing and life would be impossible forever. The ultimate ecological catastrophe - vacuum decay. (Theme music) To explain how our universe could destroy itself, we need to understand two principles: One - energy levels. A core idea in physics is that everything has an energy level. The higher the level,
the more energy is in the system Wood, for example, has a high level. It can be burnt, a process that releases the chemical energy 
stored in its molecular bonds and turns it into heat. The ash leftover is at a lower energy level than the wood before. Two - stability. Everything in our universe tries to move towards its ground state,
in which it's completely stable and has as little energy as possible. For example, a ball on a hill is unstable and has a lot of potential energy. When disturbed,
it will roll down into the valey and lose its potential energy
in the process The ball is now
in its ground state and stable. It will remain like that. Everything in our universe follows these two principles. If something has a lot of energy, it's unstable and wants to get rid of it to become stable and reach its ground state. This is true for every system even in the weird world of quantum mechanics. If our current understanding of physics
is correct, then the universe gets its properties from quantum fields. We explained them in detail in another video. For this video, imagine them as the rules of the universe. They tell particles how to behave and interact Like everything in the universe, they want to be
in the lowest energy level possible, which is called a vacuum state. This has nothing to do with vacuum in space. It's just called this way because scientists are bad at
naming things We then call the fields reached their vacuum state, except maybe one. It's possible that the Higgs Field is not stable, but metastable, which is a fancy way of saying that it pretends to be stable but really is not. It would be a false vacuum. The Higgs Field is responsible for giving particles their mass, which rules how almost everything in the universe interacts. What would happen if the Higgs Field
is a false vacuum? Think of our ball in the valley: the ball is the Higgs Field. The valley might not be the
lowest energy state for the Higgs Field. There might an even deeper valley
that it wants to get to. This would mean that the Higgs Field
has a lot of potential energy, waiting to be released. The Higgs Field could be
like a piece of wood but drenched in gasoline, waiting to set the universe on fire. A random spark like quantum tunneling could release the potential energy of the Higgs Fields. This could happen at any time and without warning. If at any point in space, this so-called vacuum decay starts, there is no turning back. As the Higgs Field crashes into the lower energy state, it releases a massive amount of potential energy. This energy pushes the space around it over the barrier, which releases more potential energy. A sphere of the new stable Higgs Field, or true vacuum, grows at the speed of light in all directions. Imagine it like setting a sea of gasoline, the size of the universe, on fire. This sphere is surrounded by a shell of energy that devours everything it comes into contact with. Whatever it touches is eliminated for existence. The bubble will continue to grow forever. deleting the universe on its way. There is no way to be warned, since it's so fast. But there's nothing we can do anyway. Our destruction would be instant, in a fraction of second, Earth would be gone. But it actually gets worse. If the energy level of the Higgs Field changes, it changes all of physics. In the true vacuum of the sphere, the standard model will be overthrown, superseded by different physics that we don't know - how fundamental particles behave, how atoms hold together, how chemicals react. Vacuum decay won't just destroy life, it will destroy chemistry itself, making life as we know it impossible. We simply have no idea what it would be like inside. It might be a shadow of what it is now, or not. We don't know. If vacuum decay happens, the outlook is indeed grim. If you feel slightly worried now, don't be. At this point, false vacuum is speculation based on our current understanding of particle physics, which might be wrong. It's kind of like using a ruler to measure a continent. (playful music) Sure, you can do it, but you might be off by quite a bit at the end. Right now, no-one can say a vacuum decay is a thing that's real or just a scary idea. But even if one or multiple spheres of death have already started expanding, the universe is so big that they might not reach us for billions of years. If they're far enough away, they might not ever be able to reach us because of the expansion of the universe. The speed of light is not that fast on the scale of the universe. So, while vacuum decay is fascinatingly scary, right now, there are other things we should be more afraid of. In contrast to vacuum decay, we have the power to prepare for most of them.

TnzcwTyr6cE,2016-09-21T12:36:46.000000,Genetic Engineering and Diseases – Gene Drive & Malaria,"What if you could use genetic
engineering to stop humanity's most dangerous predator, the deadliest animal on the planet responsible for the death of billions, the mighty mosquito? Along
with other diseases it plays host to Malaria, one of the cruelest parasites on Earth possibly the single biggest killer of
humans in history. In 2015 alone hundreds of millions were infected and almost half a million people died. A new technology could help us eradicate Malaria forever, but to do so we need to engineer a whole animal population. This is not a hypothetical problem, the
modified mosquitoes already exist in a lab. Should we use the technology, and is
malaria bad enough to risk it? (Intro Music) Malaria is caused by a group of
microorganisms: Plasmodia, very weird microorganisms that consists of just a single-cell, they're parasites that completely rely on mosquitoes. Malaria always starts with an insect bite. In it's salivary glands, thousands of sporozoites wait until the insect penetrates your skin, immediately after invading you they head for the liver where they quietly enter big cells and hide from the immune system. For up to a month they stay here in stealth mode consuming the cells
alive and changing into their next form: small drop like merozoites, they multiply generating thousands of themselves and then burst out of the cells. So thousands
of parasites head into the bloodstream to look for their next victims, Red blood
cells, to stay unnoticed, they wrap themselves in the membranes of the cells
they killed. Imagine that! Killing someone from the inside and then taking their
skin as camouflage, brutal! They now violently attack red blood cells,
multiplying inside them until they burst then finding more red blood cells and
this cycle repeats over and over. Pieces of dead cells spread lots of toxic waste
material, which activates a powerful immune response causing flu-like
symptoms, among the symptoms are high fever, sweats and chills, convulsions,
headaches and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea. If malaria breaches the
blood-brain barrier it can cause coma, neurological damage or death. The
parasites are ready for evacuation now. When another mosquito bites the infected
human they get a ride, the cycle can start over. In 2015, the Zika virus, which
causes horrible birth defects if it infects pregnant women, spread rapidly
into new areas around the globe. It too is carried by a mosquito. The mosquito is the
perfect carrier for human diseases they've been around for at least 200
million years. There are trillions of them and a single one can lay up to 300
eggs at a time. They are practically impossible to eradicate and the perfect
parasite taxi. But today we have a new revolutionary technology, that could
enable us to finally win the war against them; CRISPR. For the first time
in human history, we have the tools to make fast, large-scale changes to entire
species, changing their genetic information as we please. So instead of attacking isolated groups
of insects, why not just change the types that transmit diseases? Using genetic engineering, scientists successfully created a strain of
mosquitoes that are immune to the malaria parasite by adding a new
antibody gene that specifically targets plasmodium. These mosquitoes will never
spread malaria. But just changing genetic information is not enough. The edits
would only be inherited by half the offspring because most genes have two
versions inside the genome as a fail-safe. So after just two generations,
at most only half of the offspring would carry the engineered gene. In a population
of billions of mosquitoes they would hardly make a difference. A genetic engineering method called the gene drive solves this problem. It forces the new gene to become
dominant in the following generations overpowering the old gene almost
completely. Thanks to this twist, 99.5% of all
the engineered mosquitoes offspring will carry the anti-malaria edit. If we were
to release enough engineered mosquitoes into the wild to mate with normal mosquitoes,
the malaria blocking gene would spread extremely quickly. As the new gene becomes a permanent feature of the mosquito population, Plasmodium would
lose its home base. Scientists hope that the change would be
so fast that they could not adapt to it quickly enough. Malaria could virtually
disappear. If you take into account that maybe half a million children are killed
by it every year, about five have died since this video started. Some scientists
argue that we should use the technology sooner, rather than later. The mosquitoes themselves would probably
only profit from this, they don't have anything to gain from carrying parasites
and this might only be the first step Malaria might just be the beginning. Different mosquitoes also carry Dengue fever and Zika, ticks transmit Lyme
disease, flies transmit sleeping sickness fleas transmit the plague. We could save
millions of lives and prevent suffering on an unbelievable scale. So, why haven't we
done this yet? For one, CRISPR editing is barely four years old, so until very
recently we just couldn't do it as fast and easily. And there are valid concerns. Never before have humans consciously
changed the genetic code of a free-living organism on this scale. Once we do it, there is no going back. So it has to be
done right, because there could be unwanted consequences if we set out to
edit nature. In this specific case of malaria though,
the risk might be acceptable since the genetic modification doesn't
make a big change in the overall genome. It only changes a very specific part. The worst-case scenario here, is probably that it might not work or that the
parasite adapts in a negative way. There is still much debate. Technology as powerful as gene drive, needs to be handled with a lot of care but at some
point we have to ask ourselves: Is it unethical to not use this technology,
when every day 1,000 children die. Humanity has to decide how to act on
this in the next few years. The public discussion is way behind the technology
in this case. What do you think? This video was made possible in part by

jAhjPd4uNFY,2016-08-10T12:01:38.000000,Genetic Engineering Will Change Everything Forever – CRISPR,"magine you were alive back in the 1980's, and were told that computers would soon take over everything: from shopping, to dating, and the stock market, that billions of people would be connected via a kind of web, that you would own a handheld device, orders of magnitudes more powerful than supercomputers. It would seem absurd, but then, all of it happened. Science fiction became our reality, and we don't even think about it. We're at a similar point today with genetic engineering. So, let's talk about it. Where it came from, what we're doing right now, and about a recent breakthrough, that will change how we live and what we perceive as normal, forever. Humans have been engineering life for thousands of years. Through selective breeding, we strengthened useful traits in plants and animals. We became very good at this, but never fully understood how it worked. Until we discovered the code of life, Deoxyribonucleic Acid—DNA. A complex molecule that guides the growth, development, function, and reproduction of everything alive. Information is encoded in the structure of the molecule. Four nucleotides are paired and make up a code that carries instructions. Change the instructions and you change the being carrying it. As soon as DNA was discovered, people tried to tinker with it. In the 1960's, scientist bombarded plants with radiation to cause random mutations in the genetic code. The idea was to get a useful plant variation by pure chance. Sometimes it actually worked too. In the 70's, scientists inserted DNA
snippets into bacteria, plants, and animals to study and modify them for
research, medicine, agriculture, and for fun. The earliest genetically modified animal
was born in 1974, making mice a standard tool for research, saving millions of lives. In the 80's, we got commercial. The first patent was given for a microbe engineered to absorb oil. Today we produce many chemicals by means of engineered life, like life-saving clotting factors, growth hormones, and insulin. All things we had to harvest from the organs of animals before that. The first food modified in the lab went on sale in 1994: the Flavr Savr tomato, a tomato given a much longer shelf life where an extra gene that suppresses the build-up of a rotting enzyme. But GM food and the controversy surrounding them deserve a video of their own. In the 1990's, there was also a brief
foray into human engineering. To treat maternal infertility, babies were made that carried genetic information from 3 humans. Making them the first humans ever to have 3 genetic parents. Today there are super muscled pigs, fast-growing salmon, featherless chicken, and see-through frogs. On the fun side, we made things glow in the dark. Fluorescent zebrafish are available for
as little as ten dollars. All of this is already very impressive, but until recently gene editing was extremely expensive,
complicated, and took a long time to do. This has now changed with a revolutionary new technology now entering the stage—CRISPR. Overnight, the costs of engineering have shrunk by 99 %. Instead of a year, it takes a few weeks to conduct experiments, and basically everybody with a lab can do it. It's hard to get across how big a technical revolution CRISPR is. It literally has the potential to change humanity forever. Why did this sudden revolution happen and how does it work? Bacteria and viruses have been fighting
since the dawn of life. So-called bacteriophages or phages hunt bacteria. In the ocean, phages kill 40 % of them every single day. Phages do this by inserting their own genetic code into the bacteria and taking them over to use them as factories. The bacteria tried to resist but failed most the time because their protection tools are too weak, But sometimes bacteria survive an attack. Only if they do so can they activate their most effective antivirus system: they save a part of the virus DNA in their own genetic code in a DNA archive called CRISPR. Here it's stored safely until it's needed. When the virus attacks again, the bacterium quickly makes an RNA copy from the DNA archive and arms a secret weapon—a protein called CAS9. The protein now scans the bacterium's
insides for signs of the virus invader by comparing every bit of DNA it finds to the sample from the archive. When it finds a 100-percent perfect match, it's activated and cuts out the virus
DNA, making it useless, protecting the bacterium against the attack. What's special is that CAS9 is very
precise, almost like a DNA surgeon. The revolution began when scientists figured out that the CRISPR system is programmable. You can just give it a copy of DNA you want to modify and put the system into a living cell. If the old techniques of genetic manipulation were like a map, CRISPR is like a GPS system. Aside from being precise, cheap, and easy, CRISPR offers the ability to edit live cells, to switch genes on and off, and target and study particular DNA sequences. It also works for every type of cell: microorganisms, plants, animals, or humans. But despite the revolution CRISPR is for science, it's still just a first generation tool. More precise tools are already being created and used as we speak. In 2015, scientists use CRISPR to cut the HIV virus out of living cells from patients in the lab, proving that it was possible. Only about a year later, they carried out a larger scale project with rats that had the HIV virus in basically all of their body cells. By simply injecting CRISPR into the rats tails, they were able to remove more than 50 %
of the virus from cells all over the body. In a few decades, a CRISPR therapy
might cure HIV and other retroviruses, viruses that hide inside human DNA like
Herpes could be eradicated this way. CRISPR could also defeat one of our worst enemies—cancer. Cancer occurs when cells refuse to die and keep multiplying while concealing themselves from the immune system. CRISPR gives us the means to edit your immune cells and make them better cancer hunters. Getting rid of cancer might eventually mean getting just a couple of injections of a
few thousand of your own cells that have been engineered in the lab to heal you for good. The first clinical trial for a CRISPR cancer treatment on human patients was approved in early 2016 in the
US. Not even a month later, Chinese scientists announced that they would treat lung cancer patients with immune cells modified with CRISPR in August 2016. Things are picking up pace quickly. And then there are genetic diseases. There are thousands of them and they range from mildly annoying to deadly or entail decades of suffering. With a powerful tool like CRISPR, we may be able to end this. Over 3,000 genetic diseases are caused by a single incorrect letter in your DNA. We are already building a modified
version of CAS9 that is made to change just a single letter, fixing the disease in the cell. In a decade or two, we could possibly cure thousands of diseases forever. But all of these medical applications have one thing in common: they are limited to the individual and die with them, except if you use them on reproductive cells or very early embryos. But CRISPR can and probably will be used for much more: the creation of modified humans—designer babies—and will mean gradual, but irreversible changes to the human gene pool. The means to edit the genome of a human embryo already exists. Though the technology is still in its early stages, but it has already been attempted twice. In 2015 and 2016, Chinese scientists experimented with human embryos and were partially successful on their second attempt. They showed the enormous challenges we still face in gene editing embryos, but also that scientists are
working on solving them. This is like the computer in the 70's. There will be better computers. Regardless of your personal take on
genetic engineering, it will affect you. Modified humans could alter the genome of our entire species, because their engineered traits will be passed on to their children and could spread over generations, slowly modifying the whole gene pool of humanity. It will start slowly. The first designer babies will not be overly designed. It's most likely that they will be created to eliminate a deadly genetic disease running in a family. As the technology progresses and gets
more refined, more and more people may argue that not using genetic modification is unethical, because it condemns children to preventable suffering and death and denies them the cure. But as soon as the first engineered kid is born, a door is opened that can't be closed anymore. Early on, vanity traits will mostly be left alone. But as genetic modification becomes more accepted and our knowledge of our genetic code enhances, the temptation will grow. If you make your offspring immune to Alzheimer, why not also give them an enhanced metabolism? Why not throw in perfect eyesight? How about height or muscular structure? Full hair? How about giving your child the gift of
extraordinary intelligence? Huge changes are made as a result of the personal decisions of millions of individuals that accumulate. This is a slippery slope. Modified humans could become the new standard. But as engineering becomes more
normal and our knowledge improves, we could solve the single biggest mortality risk factor: aging. Two-thirds of the 150,000 people who died today will die of age-related causes. Currently we think aging is caused by the accumulation of damage to our cells, like DNA breaks and the systems responsible for fixing those wearing off over time. But there are also genes that directly affect aging. A combination of genetic engineering and other therapy could stop or slow down aging, maybe even reverse it. We know from nature that there are animals immune to aging. Maybe we could even borrow a few genes for ourselves. Some scientists even think biological aging could be something that eventually just stops being a thing. We would still die at some point, but instead of doing so in hospitals at age 90, we might be able to spend a few thousand years with our loved ones. Research into this is in its infancy, and many scientists are rightly skeptical about the end of aging. The challenges are enormous and maybe it is unachievable, but it is conceivable the people alive today might be the first to profit from effective anti aging therapy. All we might need is for someone to convince a smart billionaire to make it their next problem to solve. On a bigger scale, we certainly could solve many problems by having a modified population. Engineered humans might be better equipped to cope with high-energy food, eliminating many diseases of civilization like obesity. In possession of a modified immune system, with a library of potential threats, we might become immune to most diseases that haunt us today. Even further into the future, we could engineer humans to be equipped for extended space travel and to cope with different conditions on another planets, which would be extremely helpful in
keeping us alive in our hostile universe. Still, a few major challenges await us: some technological, some ethical. Many of you watching will feel uncomfortable and fear that we will create a world in which we will reject non-perfect humans and pre-select features and qualities based on our idea of what's healthy. The thing is we are already living in
this world. Tests for dozens of genetic diseases or complications have become standard for pregnant women in much of the world. Often the mere suspicion of a genetic defect can lead to the end of a pregnancy. Take Down syndrome for example, one of the most common genetic defects. In Europe, about 92 % of all pregnancies where it's detected are terminated. The decision to terminate pregnancy is incredibly personal, but it's important to acknowledge the reality that we are pre-selecting humans based on medical conditions. There is also no use in pretending this will change, so we have to act carefully and respectfully as we advance the technology and can make more and more
selections. But none of this will happen soon. As powerful as CRISPR is—and it is, it's not infallible yet. Wrong edits still happen as well as unknown errors that can occur anywhere in the DNA and might go unnoticed. The gene edit might achieve the desired result—disabling a disease, but also might accidentally trigger unwanted changes. We just don't know enough yet about the
complex interplay of our genes to avoid unpredictable consequences. Working on accuracy and monitoring methods is a major concern as the first human trials begin. And since we've discussed a possible positive future, there are darker visions too. Imagine what a state like North Korea
could do if they embraced genetic engineering. Could a state cement its rule forever by forcing gene editing on their subjects? What would stop a totalitarian regime from engineering an army of modified super soldiers? It is doable in theory. Scenarios like this one are far, far off into the future, if they ever become possible at all. But the basic proof of concept for genetic engineering like this already exists today. The technology really is that powerful. While this might be a tempting reason to ban genetic editing and related research, that would certainly be a mistake. Banning human genetic engineering would only lead to the science wandering off to a place with jurisdiction and rules
that we are uncomfortable with. Only by participating can we make sure that further research is guided by caution, reason, oversight, and transparency. Do you feel uncomfortable now? Most of us have something wrong with them. In the future that lies ahead of us, would we have been allowed to exist? The technology is certainly a bit scary, but we have a lot to gain, and genetic engineering might just be a step in the natural evolution of intelligent species in the universe. We might end disease. We could extend our life expectancy by centuries and travel to the stars. There's no need to think small when it comes to this topic. Whatever your opinion on genetic engineering, the future is approaching no matter what. What has been insane science fiction is about to become our new reality, a reality full of opportunities and challenges.

RLykC1VN7NY,2016-07-31T12:00:40.000000,Death From Space — Gamma-Ray Bursts Explained,"Imagine if you could gather the energy from every star within a hundred million light years. From thousands of galaxies, each with billions of stars. Imagine, you could take this kind of power, and use it to fire the biggest super-weapon in the universe. Imagine the damage you could do. It turns out, you don't need to imagine it. These exist, and they're called gamma ray bursts. But what are these cosmic snipers? And what happens if one takes a shot at Earth? To understand gamma ray bursts, we first have to understand gamma rays. Gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation – waves which carry energy just like visible light. Visible light is a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum: it's the part your eyes can see. At lower energies, there are radio waves, microwaves and infrared. And at higher energies: ultraviolet, x-rays and gamma rays. Gamma rays are incredibly powerful. A single gamma ray photon, is more energetic than a million visible photons combined. Their high energy makes gamma rays a form of ionizing radiation. Meaning they are energetic enough, to break apart atomic bonds. This makes them dangerous to you and me. Ionizing radiation disrupts the delicate biochemical machinery that keeps us alive, like a 9mm bullet through a clock. Fortunately, on Earth, the ozone layer blocks gamma rays. Filtering them out before they can harm us. But if the atmosphere blocks gamma rays from space, how were gamma ray bursts (or GRBs) from space ever discovered? During the Cold War, the USA sent up spy satellites, which could detect gamma rays from Soviet nuclear tests in space. They didn't see any bombs, but they did observe faint bursts coming from space, lasting only a few seconds. To date, this may be the only major scientific discovery made by spy satellites (that we know about anyway). Astronomers use telescopes see different kinds of light to make their discoveries. And these spy satellites gave them a new pair of eyes. They were a mystery for thirty years but eventually, we discovered the source of a GRB: a galaxy six billion light years away. If a GRB can be seen from such a distance, then it must be incredibly energetic. Releasing more energy in a second than the sun will, in its entire ten billion year lifetime. Making GRBs, the brightest events in the universe. So, where do they come from? GRBs, accompany some of the most violent, cataclysmic deaths in the universe, and the birth of black holes. There are two types of gamma ray bursts: short and long, and each has their own source. Long GRBs last about a minute, and scientist think they are produced by supernova: when the core of a massive star collapses to become a black hole. Short GRBs last a second, and are produced when two neutron stars in a binary merge. Over millions of years, their orbits decay by emmiting gravitational waves. Once they are close enough to touch, they crash and splash into each other, forming a black hole. Both supernova and neutron star mergers the same thing: black holes, surrounded by a magnetized disc of gas left over from their parent stars. In these environments, the rotation winds up the magnetic field, which funnels hot jets of particles, traveling at nearly the speed of light. The gas in this funnel creates two tight jets of high energy gamma rays, like a celestial laser gun. So unlike other cosmic explosions, which spread out and fade, GRBs say focused, and can been seen from much further. Any more detail would require too much mathematics for a YouTube video. The universe is full of these cosmic snipers, firing blindly and randomly into the dark, and they're hitting us all the time. On average, we detect one per day. Fortunately, most are harmless. All the bursts we have detected so far, originated outside the Milky Way, too far away to hurt us. But a nearby GRB could be disastrous, if one goes off within a few light years of us, it would totally cook the surface of the Earth. Or at least, the half that's facing it. But even a more distant GRB could still end life on Earth. And it wouldn't need to score a head-shot to kill us. If originating from a few thousand light years away, it would be a hundred light years wide by the time it reaches us, washing over the Solar System like a tidal wave. Again, the ozone layer protects us, but it's better equipped to handle the trickle of ultraviolet from the sun. A gamma ray burst would overwhelm it, leaving us exposed to deadly solar radiation. Ozone takes years to replenish itself by natural processes, which is more than enough time for the sun to burn the Earth sterile. Or at least, to kill most complex life. In fact, this may have already happened. A GRB has been suggested as one possible cause of the Ordovician extinction 450 million years ago, that eradicated almost 85% of all marine species. Although it's pretty much impossible to prove. Gamma ray bursts could even be one reason we don't see life anywhere else in the universe. They might be wiping clean huge chucks of it, on a regular basis. It's been suggested, that because of GRBs, only 10% of all galaxies might be hospitable to life, similar to us. So, are they going to kill us? Probably not. In a galaxy like ours, there may only be one GRB per millennia. And to harm us, they must be close and directed at us. But since gamma rays travel at the speed of light, we won't know when it's headed our way until it arrives. So, there could already be a GRB on its way to kill us all, and we won't know it, until it hits us, and we're dead."
dGiQaabX3_o,2016-06-23T12:04:23.000000,What Happened Before History? Human Origins,"The world we live in feels normal, ordinary. It feels like this is just how humans exist and always existed. But, it's not. Never before have we humans lived in a world as sophisticated and engineered to our needs as today. Giving us the luxury to forget about ourselves and not worry about survival. Food, shelter, security – all of this is, more or less, taken for granted. But we're a special few; for more than 99.99% of human history, life was completely different. And there's no such thing as just one human history. Our story begins 6 million years ago, when the tribe of hominini split and our relationship with the apes ended. 2.8 million years ago, the genus of homo, the first humans, emerged. We like to think about ourselves as the only humans, but this is far from the truth. When we, homo sapiens sapiens, came into existence 200,000 years ago, there were at least six other human species around. Cousins of comparable intelligence and ability, which must have been incredibly scary, kind of like living with aliens. Some of them were very successful. Homo erectus, for example, survived for 2 million years. Ten times longer than modern humans have existed. The last of the other humans disappeared around 10,000 years ago. We don't know what caused them to die out. Modern humans have at least a few percent of neanderthal and other human DNA, so there was some mixing, but certainly not enough to be a merger between species. So we don't know if our cousins went away because they lost the battle over resources, or because of a series of minor genocides. Either way, only we remain. Back to the beginnings of humanity. 2.8 million years ago, early humans used tools, but did not make a lot of progress for nearly 2 million years. Until they learned to control fire. Fire meant cooking, which made food more nutritious, which contributed to the development of our brain. It also produced light and warmth, which made days longer and winters less gruesome. On top of that, it not only scared predators away, it could also be used for hunting. A torched wood or grassland provided small animals, nuts and tubers that were pre-roasted. From 300,000 years ago, most of the different human species lived in small hunter-gatherer societies. They had fire, wood and stone tools, planned for the future, buried their dead, and had cultures of their own. But most importantly, they spoke to each other. Probably in a kind of proto-language, less complex than ours. If we had a time machine, how far would we be able to go back, steal a few babies and raise them today without anyone noticing that they're a bit different? There is much debate. Anatomically, modern humans emerged 200,000 years ago, but probably 70,000 years is as far as we could travel back and still snatch a behaviourally modern human. Before that, the babies would probably lack a few crucial gene mutations Necessary to build a brain with modern language and abstract thinking abilities. At some point, around 50,000 years ago, there was an explosion in innovation. Tools and weapons became more sophisticated and culture became more complex, because at this point, humans had a multi-purpose brain, and a more advanced language to communicate information with each other effectively, and down to the last detail. This allowed much closer cooperation, and is what really makes us different from any other creature on Earth. Not our comparatively weak bodies and inferior senses, but the ability to cooperate flexibly in large groups, unlike, for example, rigid beehives or intimate, but tiny wolf packs. As our brain evolved, we became able to do something, life had been unable to do up to this point. One – expand knowledge quickly. Two – preserve the knowledge gained over generations. Three – build on past knowledge, to gain even deeper insight. This seems daft, but until then, information had to be passed on from generation to generation, mostly through genetics, which is not efficient. Still, for the next 40,000 years, human life remained more or less the same. There was little to build upon. Our ancestors were only one animal among many. Building a skyscraper without knowing what a house is… is hard. But while it is easy to be arrogant in our attitude to our ancestors, this would be ignorant. Humans 50,000 years ago were survival specialists. They had a detailed mental map of their territory, their senses were fine-tuned to the environment, they knew and memorized a great amount of information about plants and animals. They could make complicated tools that required years of careful training and very fine motor skills Their bodies compared to our athletes today just because of their daily routines, and they lived a rich social life within their tribe Survival required so many skills that the average brain volume of early modern humans might even have been bigger than it is today As a group we know more today, but as individuals our ancestors were superior to us But then around 12,000 years ago, in multiple locations, humans developed agriculture. Everything changed very quickly. Before, survival as a hunter and forager required superb physical and mental abilities in all fields from everybody With the rise of the agricultural age, individuals could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival. This meant that some of them could specialize. Maybe they worked on better tools, maybe they took time to breed more resistant crops or better livestock, Maybe they started inventing things. As farming got more and more efficient, what we call civilization began Agriculture gave us a reliable and predictable food source, which allowed humans to hoard food on a large scale for the first time, which is much easier to do with grains than meat, The food stock required protection, which led to communities living together in tighter spaces First, early defense structures were built, the need for organization grew The more organized we got, the faster things became efficient Villages became cities, cities became kingdoms, kingdoms became empires Connections between humans exploded which led to opportunities to exchange knowledge Progress became exponential About 500 years ago the Scientific Revolution began Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, Biology, and Chemistry transformed everything we thought we knew The Industrial Revolution followed soon after laying the foundation for the modern world As our overall efficiency grew exponentially, more people could spend their lifetime contributing to the progress of humanity Revolutions kept happening. The invention of the computer, its evolution into a medium we all use on a daily basis, and the rise of the Internet shaped our world It's hard to grasp how fast all of that happened It's been about 125,000 generations since the emergence of the first human species About 7,500 generations since the physiologically modern humans saw the light of day 500 generations ago, what we call civilization began 20 generations ago, we learned how to do science And the Internet became available to most people only one generation ago Today we live in the most prosperous age humanity has ever experienced We have transformed this planet, from the composition of its atmosphere to large-scale changes in its landscape and also in terms of the other animals in existence. We light up the night with artificial stars and put people in a metal box in the sky Some have even walked on our Moon We put robots on other planets We've looked deep into the past of the universe with mechanical eyes Our knowledge and our way of acquiring and storing more of it has exploded The average high school student today knows more about the universe than a scholar a few centuries ago Humans dominate this planet, even if our rule is very fragile We are still not that different from our ancestors 70,000 years ago But your lifestyle has existed for less than 0.001% of human history From here on, there's no saying what the future holds for us We're building a skyscraper, but we're not sure if it's standing on a solid foundation or if we're building it on quicksand Let's leave it with that for now The next time you miss your train, your burger is not hot enough, or someone cuts in line Remember how special this made-up human world is Maybe it's not worth being upset about all those little things. OK, so this was our first take on making a history-related video we'd love to make much more of them, but they take even more time than our average video. So we might do 3 or 4 a year.

JQVmkDUkZT4,2016-05-31T13:24:38.000000,What Are You?,"Are you your body? Well, kind of, right? But is there a line where this stops being true? How much of yourself can you remove, before you stop being you? And does the question even make sense? Your physical existence is cells, trillions of them, at least ten times more than there are stars in the milky way. A cell is a living being, a machine make of up to 50,000 different proteins. It has no consciousness, no will, no purpose; it just is. But it is still an individual. Together, your cells form huge structures for jobs like preparing food, gathering resources, transporting stuff around, scanning the enviroment, and so on. If you extract cells from your body, and put them in the right enviroment, they will continue to stay alive for a while. So, your cells can exist without you, but you can't exist without them. If we take all the cells away, there is no 'you' anymore. Is there a line where a pile of your cells stops being you? For example, if you donate an organ, billions of your cells will continue to live on inside someone else. Does this mean that a part of you became a part of another person? Or is this other body keeping a part of you alive? Or let us imagine an experiment: you and a random person from the street exchange cells. One at a time, your body gets one of their cells, their body gets one of your cells. At which point would they become you? Would they ever? Or is this just a very slow and gross way to teleport you? Let's make this more complicated! The image of ourselves as a static thing is untenable. Almost all of your cells have to die during your lifetime. 250 million have died since the beginning of this video alone. Between one and three million per second. In a seven year period most of your cells are replaced at least once. Everytime you cells set up changes, you are slightly different than before. So, a part of you is dying contantly. If you are lucky enough to become old, you would have cycled through roughly a million billion cells. So what you consider yourself is really just a snapshot. But sometimes, cells are broken and don't want to die, questioning the very nature of the unity of our bodies. We call them cancer. They cancel the biological social contract and become basically immortal. Cancer is not an outside invader; it's a part of you that puts its own survival over yours. But you could also argue that a cancer cell becomes an other entity inside us - another being that just wants to thrive and survive. Can we blame it for that? A chilling cell story, is that of Henrietta Lacks, a young cancer patient who died in 1951. Usually, cells only survived for a few days in the lab, making research very hard. Henrietta's cancer cells were immortal. Over the decades, they were multiplied over and over again and used for countless research projects, saving countless lives. Henrietta's cells are still alive, and overall have been grown to at least 20 tons of biomass. So, there are living parts around the world from someone who has been considered dead for decades. How much of Henrietta is in these cells? What makes one of your cells you, anyway? Maybe the information contained in it: your DNA. Until recently, it was believed that all the cells in your body had basically the same genetic code. But it turns out this is wrong. Your genome is mobile, changing over time through mutations and environmental influences. This is especially the case in your brain. According to recent discoveries, a single neuron in an adult brain has more than one thousand mutations in its genetic code that are not present in the cells surrounding it. But how much you is your DNA really? About 8% of the human genome is made up of viruses that once infected our ancestors and merged with us. Mitochondria, power plants of the cell, once were bacteria, that merged with the ancestors of your cells. They still have their own DNA An average cell has hundreds of them, hundreds of little things that are not really human, but they still kind of are. It is confusing. Let's backtrack a bit. We know that you're made up of trillions of little things, made from more little things, that are constantly changing. Together, all those little things are not static, but dynamic. Their composition and condition is changing constantly. So, we might just be a self-sustaining pattern, without clear borders, that gained self awareness at some point, and now has the ability to think about itself through time and space, but really only exists in this exact very moment. Where did this pattern start? With your conception? When the first human arose? When life first began conquering our small planet? Or when the elements that make up your body were forged in a star? Our human brains evolved to deal with absolutes. The fuzzy borders that make up reality are hard to grasp. Maybe ideas like beginning and end, life and death, you and me, are really not absolutes, but ideas belonging to a fluent pattern, a pattern that is lost in this strange and beautiful universe. The problem of who we are isn't just a question about ourselves, but it is also a question of our minds. Just as our cells can be divided and separated from us, so can our very brains be divided and separated from us - while still in the skull... Click here to go to my channel, and watch the next part.

ZL4yYHdDSWs,2016-05-12T14:28:36.000000,How Far Can We Go? Limits of Humanity (Old Version – Watch the New One),"Is there a border we will never cross? Are there places we will never reach, no matter how hard we try? Turns out there are. Even with science fiction technology, we are trapped in our pocket of the universe. How can that be? And how far can we go? We live in a quiet arm of the Milky Way a spiral galaxy of average size about one hundred thousand light years across, consisting of billions of stars, gas clouds, dark matter, black holes, neutron stars, and planets, with a supermassive black hole in the galactic centre. From afar, our galaxy seems dense, but in reality it consists mostly of empty space With our current technology, sending a human to the closest star will take thousands of years So our galaxy is... pretty big. The Milky Way is not alone, though. Along with the Andromeda galaxy and more than fifty dwarf galaxies, it's part of the ""local group"" a region of space about ten million light years in diameter It is one of hundreds of galaxy groups in the Laniakea Supercluster. Which itself is only one of millions of superclusters that make up the observable universe. Now, let's assume for a moment that we have a glorious future. Humanity becomes a type 3 civilization, does not get wiped out by aliens, and develops interstellar travel based on our current understanding of physics. In this best case scenario, how far could we possibly go? Well, the Local Group. It is the biggest structure that humanity will ever be a part of. While it is certainly huge, the Local Group accounts for only 0.00000000001% of the observable universe. Let this number sink in for a moment. We are limited to a hundred billionth of a percent of the observable universe. The simple fact that there is actually a limit for us, and that there is so much universe that we will never be able to touch is kind of frightening. Why can't we go further? Well, it all has to do with the nature of nothing. Nothing, or empty space, isn't empty but has energy intrinsic to itself, so-called quantum fluctuations. On the smallest scale, there is constant action. Particles and anti-particles appearing and annihilating themselves. You can imagine this quantum vacuum as a bubbling pot with denser and less dense regions. Now, let's go back 13.8 billions of years, when the fabric of space consisted of nothing at all. Right after the Big Bang, in a event known as cosmic inflation, the observable universe expanded from the size of a marble to trillions of kilometres in fractions of a second. This sudden stretching of the universe was so fast and extreme that all of those quantum fluctuations were stretched as well, and subatomic distances became galactic distances. With dense, and less dense regions. After inflation, gravity began to pull everything back together. At the larger scale, the expansion was too quick and powerful to overcome, but at smaller scales gravity emerged victorious. So, over time, the denser regions or pockets of the universe... grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in today. Only stuff inside our pocket, the Local Group, is bound to us gravitationally. But wait, what's the problem then? Why can't we travel from our pocket to the next one? Here, dark energy makes everything complicated. About six billion years ago, dark energy took over. It's basically an invisible force or effect that causes and speeds up the expansion of the universe. We don't know why, or what dark energy is. But we can observe its effect clearly. In the early universe there were larger cold spots around the Local Group... that grew into large clusters with thousands of galaxies. We are surrounded by a lot of stuff. But none of those structures and galaxies outside of the Local Group are gravitationally bound to us. So the more the universe expands, the larger the distance between us and other gravitational pockets becomes. Over time, dark energy will push the rest of the universe away from us, causing all the other clusters, galaxies and groups to eventually become unreachable. The next galaxy group is already millions of light years away. But all of them are moving away from us at speeds we can't ever hope to match. We could leave the Local Group and fly through intergalactic space into the darkness, but we would never arrive anywhere. While we will become more and more stranded, the Local Group will become more tightly bound and merge together to form one giant elliptical galaxy with the unoriginal name: Milkdromeda... In a few billion years. But it becomes even more depressing. At some point, the galaxies outside the Local Group will be so far away... that they will be too faint to detect ... and the few photons that do make it to us will be shifted to such long wavelengths that they will be undetectable. Once this happens, no information outside the Local Group will be able to reach us. The universe will recede from view. It will appear to be dark and empty in all directions, forever. A being born in the far future in Milkdromeda will think there is nothing but its own galaxy in the entire universe! When they look far into empty space, they will only see more emptiness and darkness. They won't be able to see cosmic background radiation, and they won't be able to learn about the Big Bang. They will have no way of knowing what we know today. The nature of the expanding universe, when it began, and how it will end. They will think the universe is static and eternal. Milkdromeda will be an island in the darkness, slowly getting darker and darker. Still, with its trillion stars, the Local Group is certainly large enough for humanity. After all, we still haven't figured out how to leave our Solar System... and we have billions of years to explore our galaxy. We have the incredible luck to exist at the perfect moment in time, to see not only our future, but also our most distant past. As isolated and remote as the Local Group is, we can perceive the entire universe, grand and spectacular, as it is right now. Thanks so much for the help of the video to Ethan Seagal.

V9_PjdU3Mpo,2016-04-14T19:51:08.000000,Safe and Sorry – Terrorism & Mass Surveillance,"Terrorism is very scary, especially
when it happens close to home and not in some faraway place. Nobody likes to be afraid, and we were
eager to make the fear go away. So we demanded more security. In the last decade, it’s become
increasingly normal for civil liberties to be eroded and for
government agencies to spy on citizens, to collect and store
their personal information. Regardless of whether you’re a fan of
right- or left-wing policies, this affects every one of us. So we have to take a look at the data
and ask ourselves honestly, “Has all of this actually made us safer?” In the aftermath of 9/11,
the US government concluded that the law had not
kept pace with technology. It created the
Terrorist Surveillance Program initially to intercept communications
linked to al-Qaeda. Officials were confident that if the
program had been in place before 9/11, the hijackers could have been stopped. But soon the new powers were also used
to prove guilt by association. The FBI used immigration
records to identify Arab and Muslim foreign
nationals in the US. On this basis, 80,000 individuals
were required to register, another 8,000 were called in
for FBI interviews, and more that 5,000 locked up
in preventive detention. Not one terrorist was found in
what’s been called the most aggressive national
campaign of ethnic profiling since World War II. How commonplace it’s since become
for government agencies to collect and store
the personal data of citizens was made plain by the leak of
the Snowden documents in 2013. They showed how the NSA
can demand information about users from firms
like Microsoft or Google in addition to their daily collection of
data from civilian internet traffic such as email content and contact lists. So, instead of focusing on criminals, governments are increasingly
turning their attention to everyone. But if you are looking
for a needle in a haystack, adding more hay to the stack isn’t going
to make it any easier to find the needle. On the contrary, every recent success
announced by the NSA has come from classic target surveillance. Despite high hopes,
the NSA surveillance program has not stopped any
major terror attack. For instance, one of the Boston Marathon
bombers was already a target of the FBI. So what we need is not even
more random data, but better ways to understand and
use the information we have. Spy agenices are also pushing
to cripple encryption. In early 2016, the FBI asked Apple
to produce a backdoor program to disable the encryption
of a terrorist’s iPhone. Apple publicly declined, not only because
this tool could be used to permanently weaken the privacy of
law-abiding citizens worldwide, but fearing to open the floodgates for
governments requesting access to a technology used
by billions of people, a fear shared by security
experts and cryptographers. A few weeks later, the FBI revealed that
they had hacked the phone themselves, basically admitting that they lied to
the public about the need for a backdoor, which questions how trustworthy
spy agencies are in the debate about privacy and security, especially considering that the NSA,
for example, already has the capability to turn on your iPhone microphone
or activate your laptop camera without you noticing. Concerns about this are often met
with the argument, “If you have nothing to hide,
you have nothing to fear.” But this reasoning only creates
a climate of oppression. Wanting to keep certain parts
of your life private doesn’t mean you’re
doing anything wrong. Right now, we live in a democracy. But imagine the damage the wrong person
could do with all our data and such easy access to our devices. Anti-terrorism laws allow the authorities
to investigate and punish non-terrorism-related crimes
more aggressively. If you give law enforcement powerful
tools, they will use them. That’s why democratic oversight
is so important: even if those tools and laws aren’t
used against you today, they might be tomorrow. For example, following
the November 2015 Paris attacks, France expanded its already
extensive anti-terrorism laws by giving law enforcement greater
powers to conduct house raids and place people under house arrest. Within weeks, evidence emerged that
these powers were being used for unintended purposes, such as
quashing climate change protests. The governments of Spain,
Hungary, and Poland have introduced more restrictive laws
on the freedom of assembly and speech. Freedom of expression
and the press in Turkey has been seriously undermined
in the last few years, with people sentenced to prison
for criticizing the government. None of this is effectively
helping us fight terrorism. The motivation behind this
might be good, even noble, but if we let our elected governments
limit our personal freedom, the terrorists are winning. What’s worse, if we’re not careful, we might slowly move
towards a surveillance state. The data is pretty clear: the erosion of
rights, along with mass surveillance, hasn’t led to significant
successes so far, but it has changed
the nature of our society. Terrorism is a complicated problem… …without simple solutions. No security apparatus
can prevent a few guys from building a bomb in their basement. We should keep the principle
of proportionality in mind. Creating master keys to
enter millions of phones is not the same as
searching a single house. In most countries, the law already
permits a wide range of actions, including targeted surveillance. To take full advantage of
this existing potential, we need better international cooperation and more effective security
and foreign policies, better application of our present laws
instead of new and stricter ones that undermine our freedom. Let us not, out of fear, destroy
what we are most proud of: democracy and our fundamental
rights and liberties. This video was made possible

qPQQwqGWktE,2016-04-08T16:40:30.000000,Space Elevator – Science Fiction or the Future of Mankind?,"It's hard to get to space As much as we all wish there were an easy, and affordable way to see our planet
floating in the dark Right now, the only way is to become
an astronaut or a billionare But there is a concept
that might make it possible -while serving as the starting point
for the exploration of the universe- The space elevator How exactly does it work? To understand how a space elevator
will get us into space We must first understand
what an orbit is Being in orbit basically means
falling towards something, but moving fast enough to miss If you throw a ball on earth
it makes an arch through the air, and then hits the ground In space, gravity makes you move
much the same way, but if you move sideways fast enough the curvature of the earth makes the ground
fall away beneath you as fast as gravity pulls you towards it So, to enter Earth's orbit
rockets have to go up and sideways fast By contrast, a space elevator
taps into energy from Earth's rotation to get the cargo going fast Imagine a child spinning a toy on a rope
with an ant on the child's hand As the ant climbs out along the rope it starts to move faster and faster
as it ascends Compared to rockets,
with cargo launched on an elevator you only need to provide
the energy to go up Fast sideways movement comes free
with the Earth's rotation But the space elevator would without a doubt be the single largest and most expensive
structure ever built by humans So, is it worth it? It all comes down to costs Rockets burn a huge amount of rocket fuel just to get a small
amount of cargo into space At current prices, it costs about $20,000
to put one kilogram of payload into space that's $1.3 million dollars
for the average human $40 million dollars for your car billions for 
an international space station This immense cost is one of the major
limitations of human spaceflight Even with advancing technology, this cost isn't likely to be comparable with the
price of an airline ticket anytime soon A space elevator would solve this problem After construction, a space elevator is projected to reduce the cost 
one hundredfold to $200 per kilogram If an inexpensive space elevator
costs 20 billion dollars, then we'll recoup our losses
after launching only one million tons Close to the weight
of two international space stations So what would a space elevator look like
in real life? A space elevator has four major components: the tether, anchor, counterweight
and climber The elevator part of the space elevator
is the tether and the climber It extends from the surface of the Earth to space The climber is like a conventional
elevator carriage A chamber that works its way
up and down the tether At the base would be an anchor pinning the tether to the Earth
along with a port for climbers At the top is the counterweight
which holds up the tether The tether is held tight like a rope and supported from above
by the tension from the counterweight Located higher than 36,000 kilometers
above the Earth's surface At the counterweight
could be a space station, a launching point for all missions
from the spaceport elevator But can we actually build one? It's hard to say The biggest challenge is the tether It needs to be light, affordable and more stable than any material
we can produce right now There are promising materials
like graphene and diamond nanothreads, but even they may not be strong enough And aside from being incredibly strong, the tether would also have to withstand
atmospheric corrosion, radiation and micrometeorite and debris impacts Additionally, it takes several days
to climb the elevator How do we power the climber? It requires a lot of energy to go up Do we need a nuclear reactor
on our elevator carriage? Or do we beam it power from the ground
with a super powered laser? And where do we get the raw materials
for a 36,000-kilometer-long tether? Do we make it on Earth
and launch it into space? Or do we make it in space
and lower it down to the Earth? Could asteroid mining be the answer? Put simply, there are still some major
technological hurdles to overcome And a space elevator is not without risk Should the tether break,
it would collapse in spectacular style If it breaks near the anchor the force exerted by the counterweight
will cause the entire elevator to rise up ascending into space Should it break near the counterweight the tether will fall, wrapping around the world
and whipping the end off The resulting debris in orbit could pose
serious problems to future spaceflight If we build a space elevator on Earth,
we have to do it right the first time For these reasons some experts
have proposed first building a space elevator on the Moon The Moon's gravity
is much weaker than the Earth's so a flimsier but existing material
like kevlar could serve as a tether Even with all these challenges, the payoff of having a working
space elevator would be immense It might be the first step to truly becoming
a space-faring civilization Maybe we will never build
a space elevator, but in trying to do so
we might learn an awful lot And when it comes
to the exploration of the universe, there can't be too many dreams
of a glorious future"
xZbcwi7SfZE,2016-03-16T17:13:52.000000,The Antibiotic Apocalypse Explained,"What would you say if we told you
that humanity is currently making a collaborative effort to
engineer the perfect superbug? A bug that could kill hundreds
of millions of people? Well, it is happening right now. We are in the process
of creating a superbacterium. Bacteria are among the oldest
living things on this planet. The smallest thing we still consider life,
they are masters of survival and can be found everywhere. Most bacteria are harmless to us. Your body hosts trillions of them,
and they help you to survive. But others can invade your body,
spread quickly, and kill you. Millions of people used to die as a result
of bacterial infections. Until we developed
a superweapon—antibiotics. Together with vaccinations, antibiotics
revolutionized medicine and saved millions of lives. Antibiotics kill the vast majority of
susceptible bacteria fairly quickly, leaving only a small group of survivors that our immune system
then deals with easily. How do antibiotics do this? Imagine a bacterium as
a very complex machine with thousands of complex processes
going on that keep it alive and active. Antibiotics disrupt
this complex machinery, for example, by
interfering with its metabolism, slowing down their growth significantly,
so they are less of a threat. Other antibiotics attack DNA
and prevent it from being replicated, which stops bacteria from multiplying,
ultimately killing them. Or by simply ripping the outer layer
of the bacteria to shreds, so that their insides spill
out and they die quickly. All of this without bothering body cells. But now, evolution is making
things more complicated. By pure random chance, a small minority
of the bacteria invading your body might have evolved a way
to protect themselves. For example, by intercepting
the antibiotics and changing the molecule
so it becomes harmless. Or by investing energy in pumps
that eject the antibiotics before they can do damage. A few immune bacteria
are not that big a deal, because the immune system
can take care of them. But if they escape, they
might spread their immunity. How can bacteria spread immunity? First of all, bacteria
have two kinds of DNA: the chromosome and small
free-floating parts called plasmids. They can hug each other
and exchange those plasmids to exchange useful abilities. This way, immunity can be
spread quickly through a population. Or, in a process called transformation,
bacteria can harvest dead bacteria and collect DNA pieces. This even works between
different bacteria species and can lead to superbugs, bacteria
that are immune to multiple antibiotics. A variety of superbugs
already exist in the world. Especially hospitals are the
perfect breeding grounds for them. Humans have short memories. The horrors of the pre-antibiotic
era have been forgotten. Today, we treat this powerful medicine
as a commodity instead of as the game-changing
achievement of science that it is. This has led to a strange disconnect: hundreds of millions of people
still don’t have access to antibiotics in developing countries, while in other parts of the world
antibiotics are prescribed too freely and taken without care. Antibiotics should be a last-resort drug, not something you take
because your cold is annoying. Another serious problem is
antibiotic use in meat production. At any particular point in time,
humanity holds between 20 and 30 billion
animals as livestock. To make meat cheaper, many animals
are held in horrible conditions, in very tight spaces, and
in unhygienic conditions, the perfect breeding ground for disease. So many animals are given antibiotics
to kill as many bacteria as possible and prevent them from getting sick. Because a cheeseburger
has to cost a dollar. Unsurprisingly, as a
result of this system, we have created
more and more bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. To counteract this, we
use different antibiotics and we have another secret weapon:
there are specific antibiotics that are used to wipe out bacteria
that have developed resistance. There are strict rules for using these
to avoid the creation of a superbacterium. Or so we thought. In late 2015, scary news
arrived from China. Resistance against Colistin,
a last-ditch antibiotic, had been discovered. Colistin is an old drug and was rarely
used, because it can damage the liver. So there was little resistance against it,
which made it a great antibiotic of last resort for certain
complex infections that occur in hospitals to fight bacteria that have become immune
to a whole bunch of other drugs. Bacteria resistance to Colistin
is very, very bad news. It might destroy a last line of defense
and lead to a whole lot of dead people. How could this happen? Millions of animals in Chinese pig farms
have been given Colistin for years. Resistant bacteria developed, spreading
first from animal to animal, and then to humans without being noticed. On an average day, there are
over 100,000 flights on Earth, kind of connecting every
human on the planet. By creating the modern world,
we have also built the infrastructure for a dangerous pandemic. Still, we don’t need to panic just yet. Bacteria evolve, humans do research,
new antibiotics are developed as old ones become obsolete,
technology is advancing every day. The problem is real and serious,
but the fight is far from over. If humanity plays its cards right,
superbugs might turn out to be not very super after all. This video was made possible

wJUXLqNHCaI,2016-03-01T17:22:49.000000,Why The War on Drugs Is a Huge Failure,"Over 40 years ago,
US President Richard Nixon declared drug abuse
public enemy number one, starting an unprecedented global campaign,
the War on Drugs. Today, the numbers are in. The War on Drugs is a huge failure,
with devastating unintended consequences. It led to mass incarceration in the US; to corruption, political destabilization,
and violence in Latin America, Asia, and Africa; to systemic human rights
abuses across the world. It negatively affected the
lives of millions of people. All of this while we waste
billions of dollars every year only to create and fuel
powerful drug cartels while the goal of the War on Drugs
seems less achievable than ever: a world without drugs. How could this happen? The core strategy of the War on Drugs is
“no drugs, no problems”. So almost all of the efforts
in the last few decades have been focused on eradicating
the supply of drugs and incarcerating drug traffickers. But this ignores the most
fundamental of market forces, supply and demand. If you reduce the supply of anything
without reducing the demand first, its price goes up. This might lower sales for many products,
but not for drugs. The drugs market is not price-sensitive. Drugs will be consumed
no matter what they cost. So the effect is to encourage
production of more drugs and recruitment of more traffickers,
which increases availability. This is also known as the balloon effect:
even if drug production or a major supply route is destroyed, the
supply for the end user is not reduced. A perfect example of this is crystal meth. The US Government tried
to stop its production by strictly regulating the sale of
chemicals used to manufacture the drug. This forced big meth producers
out of business, but the unintended consequences were that
thousands of small-scale operations started all over the country, mostly
in small towns and rural communities, using chemicals that weren’t regulated. In response to this, some US states wanted
to reduce the supply of home-grown meth by regulating even more chemicals, which reduced small-scale
meth production drastically. But the supply of
meth still stayed the same. Mexican drug cartels immediately took over
and opened big production operations. Their meth was even better
than it was before, and they had lots of
experience in smuggling. So all these efforts made meth
production more professional, the drug more potent, while
supply wasn’t reduced at all. You can’t win this war on the supply side. Not only are drugs widely available,
demand unbroken, and some drugs purer than in the past,
with a budget of around $30 billion, the US Drug Enforcement Agency has
an efficiency rate of less than 1% when it comes to stopping
the flow of drugs into the US and inside the US. For many minors around the world, it’s
as easy to get illegal drugs as alcohol. But it doesn’t stop here. Prohibition may prevent a certain
amount of people from taking drugs, but in the process it causes huge
damage to society as a whole. Many of the problems we
associate with drug use are actually caused by
the war against them. For example, prohibition
makes drugs stronger. The more potent drugs you can store
in as little space as possible, the more profit you’ll make. It was the same during
alcohol prohibition, which led to an increased consumption
of strong liquor over beer. The prohibition of drugs also led to more
violence and murders around the world. Gangs and cartels have no access to
the legal system to settle disputes, so they use violence. This led to an ever-increasing
spiral of brutality. According to some estimates,
the homicide rate in the US is 25–75% higher because of
the War on Drugs. And in Mexico, the country
on the frontline, an estimated 164,000 have been
murdered between 2007 and 2014, more people than in the war zones
of Afghanistan and Iraq in the same period, combined. But where the War on Drugs might do
the most damage to society is the incarceration of
non-violent drug offenders. For example, the United States, one of the driving forces
of the War on Drugs, has 5% of the world’s total population,
but 25% of the world’s prison population, largely due to the harsh
punishments and mandatory minimums. Minorities suffer
because of this especially. African Americans make up
40% of all US prison inmates. And while white kids are
more likely to abuse drugs, black kids are 10 times more likely
to get arrested for drug offenses. OK, but is there actually
something different we could do? Is there a way out of this mess? In the 1980s, Switzerland experienced a public health crisis
related to heroin use. HIV rates skyrocketed and
street crime became a problem. Swiss authorities tried a new strategy:
harm reduction. They opened free
heroin maintenance centers, where addicts would
be treated and stabilized. Here, people would be given
free heroin of high quality, they would get clean needles
and have access to safe injection rooms, showers, beds, and medical supervision. Social workers help them find housing and
deal with other problems in their lives. The results were a sharp drop in
drug-related crime and two thirds of the people in the
centers got regular jobs, because now they could
focus on getting better insetad of financing their addiction. Today, over 70% of all heroin addicts
in Switzerland receive treatment. HIV infections have dropped drastically. Deaths from heroin overdoses
have dropped by 50%. And drug-related street sex work and crime
has been reduced enormously. So there are methods that are
not only way cheaper, but also actually work, instead of
creating more problems. Drug prohibition led to a system
that bulldozes human rights, costs vasts sums of money, and
creates a lot of human misery, all in pursuit of an unobtainable goal. After 40 years of fighting, it’s time
to finally end the War on Drugs and move on to something better. This video was supported by

LS-VPyLaJFM,2016-01-31T11:45:37.000000,The Last Star in the Universe – Red Dwarfs Explained,"One day the last star will die and the universe will turn dark forever. It will probably be a red dwarf; a tiny kind of star. That's also one of our best bets to find alien life, and might be the last home of humanity before the universe becomes uninhabitable. So, what do we know about them, and why are they our last hope? At least 70% of stars in the universe are red dwarfs. They are the tiniest stars out there, with only about 7 to 50% of the mass of our sun. Not that much bigger than our planet Jupiter, which is still huge though. They are also very dim. It is impossible to see them with the naked eye. You have never seen one in the night sky. Even with all our technology, we can only clearly observe red dwarfs in our neighborhood. Approximately 20 of the 30 stars close to earth are red dwarfs. Like all stars, red dwarfs fuse hydrogen into helium. But while more massive stars accumulate all the fused helium in their cores, red dwarfs stay convective, meaning that the  helium and hydrogen constantly mix. So they use up their fuel incredibly slowly, before they are extinguished. Red dwarfs burn so slowly, that their average lifespan is between 1 and 10 trillion years by comparison, the Sun will survive for another 5 billion years Because the universe is only 13.75 billion years old not a single red dwarf has reached the later development stages Every single one of the trillions that exist is still a baby. Speaking of babies, the smallest star in the entire universe is also a red dwarf because small red dwarfs
are right on the verge of being a star at all. Just a tiny bit less hydrogen and
they are mere brown dwarfs: failed stars that cannot sustain a fusion reaction
for long. So what about aliens or a new home for Humanity? Since our Sun will die one day, we'll eventually need to look for a new home and where there are habitable
planets, there might also be aliens. The Kepler space observatory found that at
least half of all red dwarfs host rock planets between half and four times the
mass of our Earth. Many of them are in the habitable zone -- the area around a star where water can be liquid -- but since red dwarfs burn at relatively
cold temperatures, a planet would need to be really close to be hospitable,
probably as close as Mercury to our Sun or even closer, which brings with it all
kinds of problems. For example, a planet this close to a star would probably be
tidaly locked, meaning the same side would always face it. This side would be
incredibly hot while the shadow side would be frozen, which makes it hard for
life to develop. Although a planet with a big enough ocean might be able to distribute the star's energy and create some kind of stability. All the gravitation forces of a Red Dwarf could squeeze the planet and heat it up so much that it might loose all its water over time. These planets could end up like Venus, a hot burning hell. Another problem is that, many Red Dwarfs vary in their energy output They could be covered in star spots that can dim their emitted light by up to 40% for months Wich would cause oceans on planets to freeze over. At other times, they can emit powerful solar flares; sudden outbursts of energy incredibly powerful. These Red Dwarfs could double their brightness in minutes Wich could strip away sizable portions of a planet's atmosphere and burn it, rendering its On the other hand, their extremely long life span is a big plus. A Red Dwarf with just moderate levels of activity, could be an amazing place for a planet that hosts life. Life on Earth has existed for about 4 Billion years And, we have about a Billion years left before the sun becomes so hot, that complex life on Earth will become impossible. We will either die out or leave Earth and look for a new home. We could build a civilization for potentially trillions of years, around a Red Dwarf with the right conditions. About 5% of the Red Dwarf in the Milky Way, may host habitable, roughly Earth sized planets. That would be more than 4 Billion in total. But, life may not even need a planet like Earth. Candidates for life around a Red Dwarf may be the moons of Gas Giants, also called Super Earths Really massive rocky planets. All alone, there are an estimated 60 Billion potentially habitable planets around Red Dwarfs. And, that's in the Milky Way alone. So, Red Dwarfs might become really important for our survival in the future But, everything has to die at some point, even Red Dwarfs. When in Trillions of years, the life of the last Red Dwarf is about to end, it will not be a very spectacular event. As its hydrogen runs out, it shrinks, becoming a Blue Dwarf, burning out completely. After its fuel is spent, it's transformed into a White Dwarf, an object about as small as Earth Packed very densely and made of degenerate gasses, mostly of Helium-4 nuclei. Having no more source of energy, it will cool extremely slowly over trillions of years. Until it becomes its final form: A cold Black Dwarf. White and Black Dwarfs are so fascinating, that they deserve their own video. Anyway.. It's going to be a long time before the last in the Universe vanish It's kind of uplifting to know that, if humanity succeeds in venturing into Space We have plenty of time, before the Universe turns out the lights.

X9otDixAtFw,2015-12-23T13:21:57.000000,What Is Something?,"The simple questions are the hardest ones to answer. What is a thing? Why do things happen? And why do they happen the way they do? Let’s try to approach this step-by-step. What are you made of? You are matter which is made of molecules which are made of atoms and those are made of elementary particles. But if elementary particles are the smallest things that exist, what are they made of? To answer a simple question, let’s start simply - let’s wipe the universe clean. Away with matter ,antimatter, radiation, particles… anything. Now let’s take a closer look at absolutely nothing. What is empty space? Is it what we call a vacuum? There are no atoms, no matter, nothing. Is it really all that empty? Nothing gives us the building blocks for everything. In a sense, empty space is a lot like a vast calm ocean. While the water is very still when nothing is happening, a stiff breeze create some serious waves. Our universe works a lot like this. There are these ""oceans"" everywhere - Physicists call them “fields”. This might be strange and new. But think about radiation for example. By exciting what’s known as the electromagnetic field a little kink is created which is the particle we called the photon The particle that carries radiaton we perceive it as light This isn’t unique to light. Every particle in the universe is made this way. There are fields for every particle of matter all with their own rules. For example, along with the electromagnetic fields, there is an electron field everywhere in the universe and little kinks in that field are electrons Altogether, the fields of our universe can produce 17 particles which can be divided into three categories - The leptons, and the quarks and the bosons. Leptons consists of the electron as well as its cousins muon and tau particles. Each has an associated neutrino. Then, there are quarks. The quarks are the nuclear family of particles. They’re always found bound together in groups and pairs, and makeup protons and neutrons which make up the nuclei of atoms Together, electrons and quarks are the matter particles. They make up all the things you see. The air you breathe, the sun that warms you, the computer you’re using right now 
to distract yourself from the stuff you should be doing. But things don’t just exist, they also do stuff. In some philosophical sense, the properties of a thing are just as much a part of it as existence itself. This is where the bosons and the fields that make them come into play. While the quarks and leptons are made by matter fields, the bosons are made by force fields. We call a rule of the universe a force, and so far four fundamental forces have been discovered - Electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. These forces are the rule book of a game where the pieces are particles, and the game is the universe. They tell particles what they can do and how they can do it. Bishop’s more diagonally, massless particles move at the speed of light, nights can jump, gravity attracts. The forces are the rules for how particles interact, which ultimately make them the rules for help articles assemble into all the big things we see in the universe. Gravity isn’t just the rule for orbits around the Sun or Apples falling from trees. As a rule, it says matter attracts which build planets and stars. Electromagnetism isn’t just a rule for magnet attracting or repelling, or electric currents in light bulbs. It governs all atomic bombs, building every molecule. Together, forces and particles are sort of like the tinker toys of existence. The bosons are like messengers passed between, you could say connecting the matter particles, which they used to tell each other how to move. Each particle uses a certain set of the forces to interact with other particles. Quarks, for example, can interact with each other with electromagnetism and the strong nuclear force but electrons don’t use the strong force, just electromagnetism. The quarks exchange strong force bosons, communicating the strong nuclear attraction to each other, while the protons they build exchange particles of electromagnetism, photons with the electrons. Thus the quarks end up locked up in nuclei, while the electrons remain attached by their electric attraction building atoms. Even though the university has lots of big messy phenomenon like life, supernova and computers that seem complex on the surface, if you zoom in far enough on anything you just get 17 particles emerging form underlying fields, playing a game with four rules. To summarize, in the most basic from we know right now, this is what things are. This theory is what physicists call the Standard Model of Particle Physics. You are basically nothing more than disturbances on an ocean that’s excited by energy, and guided by forces that make up the rules of the universe. But why and what is a force? We’ll have to explore a few more simple questions to get to the bottom of this. We made some wallpapers from some of the graphics in this video, you can get them on patron.com.

e-P5IFTqB98,2015-12-15T16:33:55.000000,Black Holes Explained – From Birth to Death,"Black holes are one of the strangest things in existence. They don't seem to make any sense at all. Where do they come from... ...and what happens if you fall into one? Stars are incredibly massive collections of mostly hydrogen atoms that collapsed from enormous gas cloud under their own gravity. In their core, nuclear fusion crushes hydrogen atoms into helium releasing a tremendous amount of energy This energy, in the form of radiation, pushes against gravity, maintaining a delicate balance between the two forces. As long as there is fusion in the core, a star remains stable enough. But for stars with way more mass then our own sun the heat and pressure at the core allow them to fuse heavier elements until they reach iron. Unlike all the elements that went before, the fusion process that creates iron doesn't generate any energy. Iron builds up at the center of the star until it reaches a critical amount and the balance between radiation and gravity is suddenly broken. The core collapses. Within a fraction of a second, the star implodes. Moving at about the quarter of the speed of light, feeding even more mass into the core. It's at this very moment that all the heavier elements in the universe are created, as the star dies, in a super nova explosion. This produces either a neutron star, or if the star is massive enough, the entire mass of the core collapses into a black hole. If you looked at a black hole, what you'd really be seeing is the event horizon. Anything that crosses the event horizon needs to be travelling faster than the speed of light to escape. In other words, its impossible. So we just see a black sphere reflecting nothing. But if the event horizon is the black part, what is the ""hole"" part of the black hole? The singularity. We're not sure what it is exactly. A singularity may be indefinitely dense, meaning all its mass is concentrated into a single point in space, with no surface or volume, or something completely different. Right now, we just don't know. its like a ""dividing by zero""error. By the way, black holes do not suck things up like a vacuum cleaner, If we were to swap the sun for an equally massive black hole, nothing much would change for earth, except that we would freeze to death, of course. what would happen to you if you fell into a black hole? The experience of time is different around black holes, from the outside, you seem to slow down as you approach the event horizon, so time passes slower for you. at some point, you would appear to freeze in time, slowly turn red, and disapear. While from your perspective, you can watch the rest of the universe in fast forward, kind of like seeing into the future. Right now, we don't know what happens next, but we think it could be one of two things: One, you die a quick death. A black hole curves space so much, that once you cross the event horizon, there is only one possible direction. you can take this - literally - inside the event horizon, you can only go in one direction. Its like being in a really tight alley that closes behind you after each step. The mass of a black hole is so concentrated, at some point even tiny distances of a few centimeters, would means that gravity acts with millions of times more force on different parts of your body. Your cells get torn apart, as your body stretches more and more, until you are a hot stream of plasma, one atom wide. Two, you die a very quick death. Very soon after you cross the event horizon, you would hit a firewall and be terminated in an instant. Neither of these options are particularly pleasant. How soon you would die depends on the mass of the black hole. A smaller black hole would kill you before you even enter its event horizon, while you probably could travel inside a super size massive black hole for quite a while. As a rule of thumb, the further away from the singularity you are, the longer you live. Black holes come in different sizes. There are stellar mass black holes, with a few times the mass of sun, and the diameter of an asteroid. And then there are the super massive black holes, which are found at the heart of every galaxy, and have been feeding for billions of years. Currently, the largest super massive black hole known, is S5 0014+81. 40 billion times the mass of our sun. It is 236.7 billion kilometers in diameter, which is 47 times the distance from the sun to Pluto. As powerful as black holes are, they will eventually evaporate through a process called Hawking radiation. To understand how this works, we have to look at empty space. Empty space is not really empty, but filled with virtual particles popping into existence and annihilating each other again. When this happens right on the edge of a black hole, one of the virtual particles will be drawn into the black hole, and the other will escape and become a real particle. So the black hole is losing energy. This happens incredibly slowly at first, and gets faster as the black hole becomes smaller. When it arrives at the mass of a large asteroid, its radiating at room temperature. When it has the mass of a mountain, it radiates with about the heat of our sun. and in the last second of its life, the black hole radiates away with the energy of billions of nuclear bombs in a huge explosion. But this process is incredibly slow, The biggest black holes we know, might take up a googol year to evaporate. This is so long that when the last black hole radiates away, nobody will be around to witness it. The universe will have become uninhabitable, long before then. This is not the end of our story, there are loads more interesting ideas about black holes, we'll explore them in part 2."
JhHMJCUmq28,2015-12-08T15:32:12.000000,Quantum Computers Explained – Limits of Human Technology,"Quantum Computers Explained – Limits of Human Technology For most of our history, human technology consisted of our brains, fire, and sharp sticks. While fire and sharp sticks became power plants and nuclear weapons, the biggest upgrade has happened to our brains. Since the 1960's, the power of our brain machines has kept growing exponentially, allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time. But this process is about to meet its physical limits. Computer parts are approaching the size of an atom. To understand why this is a problem, we have to clear up some basics. In a Nutshell - By Kurzgesagt A computer is made up of very simple components doing very simple things. Representing data, the means of processing it, and control mechanisms. Computer chips contain modules, which contain logic gates, which contain transistors. A transistor is the simplest form of a data processor in computers, basically a switch that can either block, or open the way for information coming through. This information is made up of bits which can be set to either 0 or 1. Combinations of several bits are used to represent more complex information. Transistors are combined to create logic gates which still do very simple stuff. For example, an AND Gate sends an output of 1 if all of its inputs are 1, and a output of 0 otherwise. Combinations of logic gates finally form meaningful modules, say, for adding two numbers. Once you can add, you can also multiply, and once you can multiply, you can basically do anything. Since all basic operations are literally simpler than first grade math, you can imagine a computer as a group of 7-year-olds answering really basic math questions. A large enough bunch of them could compute anything from astrophysics to Zelda. However, with parts getting tinier and tinier, quantum physics are making things tricky. In a nutshell, a transistor is just an electric switch. Electricity is electrons moving from one place to another. So, a switch is a passage that can block electrons from moving in one direction. Today, a typical scale for transistors is 14 nanometers, which is about 8 times less than the HIV virus' diameter, and 500 times smaller than a red blood cell. As transistors are shrinking to the size of only a few atoms, electrons may just transfer themselves to the other side of a blocked passage via a process called Quantum Tunneling. In the quantum realm, physics works quite differently from the predictable ways we're used to, and traditional computers just stop making sense. We are approaching a real physical barrier for our technological progress. To solve this problem, scientists are trying to use these unusual quantum properties to their advantage by building quantum computers. In normal computers, bits are the smallest unit of information. Quantum computers use qubits which can also be set to one of two values. A qubit can be any two level quantum system, such as a spin and a magnetic field, or a single photon. 0 and 1 are this system's possible states, like the photons horizontal or vertical polarization. In the quantum world, the qubit doesn't have to be just one of those, it can be in any proportions of both states at once. This is called superposition. But as soon as you test its value, say, by sending the photon through a filter, it has to decide to be either vertically or horizontally polarized. So as long as it's unobserved, the qubit is in a superposition of probabilities for 0 and 1, and you can't predit which it'll be. But the instant you measure it, it collapses into one of the definite states. Superposition is a game changer. Four classical bits can be in one of two to the power of four different configurations at a time. That's 16 possible combinations, out of which you can use just one. Four qubits in superposition, however, can be in all of those 16 combinations at once. This number grows exponentially with each extra qubit. Twenty of them can already store a million values in parallel. A really weird and unintuitive property qubits can have is Entanglement, a close connection that makes each of the qubits react to a change in the other's state instantaneously, no matter how far they are apart. This means when measuring just one entangled qubit, you can directly deduce properties of it's partners without having to look. Qubit Manipulation is a mind bender as well. A normal logic gate gets a simple set of inputs and produces one definite output. A quantum gate manipulates an input of superpositions, rotates probabilities, and produces another superposition as its output. So a quantum computer sets up some qubits, applies quantum gates to entangle them and manipulate probabilities, then finally measures the outcome, collapsing superpositions to an actual sequence of 0s and 1s. What this means is that you get the entire lot of calculations that are possible with your setup, all done at the same time. Ultimately, you can only measure one of the results and it'll only probably be the one you want, so you may have to double check and try again. But by cleverly exploiting superposition and entanglement, this can be exponentially more efficient than would ever be possible on a normal computer. So, while quantum computers will not probably not replace our home computers, in some areas, they are vastly superior. One of them is database searching. To find something in a database, a normal computer may have to test every single one of its entries. Quantum computers algorithms need only the square root of that time, which for large databases, is a huge difference The most famous use of quantum computers is ruining IT security. Right now, your browsing, email, and banking data is being kept secure by an encryption system in which you give everyone a public key to encode messages only you can decode. The problem is that this public key can actually be used to calculate your secret private key. Luckily, doing the necessary math on any normal computer would literally take years of trial and error. But a quantum computer with exponential speed-up could do it in a breeze. Another really exciting new use is simulations. Simulations of the quantum world are very intense on resources, and even for bigger structures, such as molecules, they often lack accuracy. So why not simulate quantum physics with actual quantum physics? Quantum simulations could provide new insights on proteins that might revolutionize medicine. Right now, we don't know if quantum computers will be just a specallized tool, or a big revolution for humanity. We have no idea where the limits of technology are, and there's only one way to find out.

t7tA3NNKF0Q,2015-11-10T16:54:39.000000,How Facebook is Stealing Billions of Views,"A few days ago Facebook proudly announced that they'd achieved eight billion video views a day. That's really impressive, until you learn that in the first quarter of 2015, seven hundred and twenty-five of the 1000 most-viewed videos on Facebook were stolen, amassing a total of 17 billion views. Sites and content aggregators steal videos from YouTube to go viral on Facebook. These videos go viral because Facebook is cheating. They rig their algorithms so that videos uploaded into their player are preferred to YouTube links, because users should be kept as long as possible on the site so Facebook can show them as many ads as possible. This is after all their business model. But it also cheats when it comes to views. A view is counted after three seconds even if the video is muted. Which means that because of autoplay, if you scroll through your timeline slowly enough, you count as a viewer. That means engagement is terrible, compared to Youtube views, Facebook views plummet after a few seconds, because most views are not real. But large numbers are impressive, so Facebook keeps pretending. While this forced virality is weird, the real problem is the so called ""Freebooting"", the stealing of videos. Since Facebook prefers its own player, stolen videos reach way more people than the original. Lately, this has happened to us more and more often. The most recent example amassed 3.2 million views and 140,000 shares in 2 days, while our old post just reached 100,000 people and got shared 1000 times. Other creators are hit even harder, SmarterEveryDay's videos get stolen constantly, getting viewed up to 17 million times. But even this is dwarfed by examples like Tyrese Gibson, a singer who steals viral videos like this one with 86 million views on his Facebook page. He adds a link to buy his music, too. He's not alone in this, a whole group of people have built their online presence around stealing other people's work. This is really bad for independent creators. Contrary to popular belief, stolen content gives creators close to no exposure at all. Only the thief and Facebook profit from this. Quality content takes a lot of creativity, time and love. In our case, a single video literally takes hundreds of hours to make. Even we, with more than a million subscribers are dependent on the ads and exposure. Without ads, and the support of our generous patrons, we could not make videos. For a small creator, a viral video can be the difference between a career and a hobby. On YouTube, this kind of theft is not a problem, because they have major safeguards that protect content from being stolen. Although, the Content ID system is far from perfect, especially for film critics and gamers. Facebook, on the other hand, pretends everything is fine and constantly announces one milestone after the other. But things are not fine. Let's look at the process of claiming your copyright on Facebook in the last year. One: get an e-mail or tweet from a fan, that gives you a direct link to your video. It's not possible to search for your videos on Facebook yourself; you depend on luck to find your stolen videos. Two: search for 'Facebook copyright infringement' on Google, because it's actually faster this way. Three: fill out an annoyingly long contact form. Four: watch the views on your stolen videos rise. Five: Facebook finally pulls the video. Conveniently, the video has already gained 99% of all the views it will ever get. The thief doesn't have to fear any negative consequences at all. This is what succesful creators have to deal with constantly, and on top of losing out in terms of exposure and money, it just feels like a violation to be treated like that. In a recent statement, Facebook announced they want to change. But it's hard to take them seriously when it still takes days for a stolen viral video to be taken down, and Facebook does not share the profits made from it. At this point, Facebook is not a partner creators look forward to working with. They've built their video empire on stolen content, and disregard for original content creators. This is absolutely unacceptable for a corporation worth billions of dollars. Facebook is already testing various monetization models that will give the uploaders a cut of the ad revenue. Which, with the current state of play, is troubling. Right now, this is mainly being tested with big media companies, but, as creators, we don't feel like we're being asked or taken into consideration by the giant business Facebook. What can you, as a viewer, to do help here? If you spot stolen content on Facebook, make a comment linking to the original content. Alert the original creator, because only they can file a copyright report. Share this video, or the one done by SmarterEveryDay. We all want the same thing: a free internet that's the basis for creativity, community and great stuff. We sincerely hope that Facebook will soon become a partner instead an obstacle to this goal.

IXxZRZxafEQ,2015-10-15T13:15:46.000000,What Is Light?,"Light, is the connection between us and the universe. Through light, we could experience distant stars and look back at the beginning of existence itself. But, what is light? In a nutshell Light, is the smallest quantity of energy that can be transported A photon, an elementary particle without a real size That can't be split, only created or destroyed. Light also has a wave-particle duality being kind of a particle and a wave at the same time (although this is a lie) Also when we say light, we actually mean visible light which is a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum: energy in form of electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation consist of an enormous range of wavelengths and frequencies. Gamma rays have the smallest wave lengths because they are the highest energy photons. But most gamma rays are just under ten picometers, which is still way smaller than a hydrogen atom. For reference, a hydrogen atom compared to a cent is about as big as a cent compared to the Moon. Visible light is in the middle of the spectrum in a range of about 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers: about the size of a bacteria. On the other end of the spectrum, radio waves can be up to 100 kilometers in diameter. The biggest wave lengths we know exist can span from 10,000 kilometers to a baffling 100,000 kilometers, way larger than Earth. From a physics stand point, all these different waves are the same. They all have the wave-particle duality and travel at 'c', the speed of light, just at different frequencies. So what makes visible light special, then? Well... Absolutly nothing. We just happen to have evolved eyes, that are good at registering exactly this part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is not a complete coincidence though. Visible light is the only set of electromagnetic radiation that propagates when in water, which happens to be where most eyes first evolved, millions of years ago. That was a smart move, because light not only interacts with matter, it's also altered by it and can be used to gather information about the world around us,with almost no delay. Which is arguably really helpful for survival. Okay, where does light come from? A vast range of electromagnetic waves are created when atoms or molecules drop from a higher state of energy to a lower one. They lose energy and emit it in the form of radiation. At the microscopic level, visible light is created when an electron within an atom in an excited state drops to a lower energy state and loses this excess energy. The same way, incoming light can elevate an electron to a higher state of energy by being absorbed by it. Macroscopically, the moving charge of the electron creates an oscillating magnetic field, Which creates an oscillating electric field perpendicular to it. These two fields move themselves through space, transferring energy from one place to another, carrying information about its place of creation with it. Why of all the things in the universe is light the fastest thing there is? Let's change the question: What is the fastest way to travel through space in the universe? It's c, exactly two hundred ninety-nine million, seven hundred ninety-two thousand, four hundred and fifty-eight metres per second in a vacuum, one billion kilometres per hour. Electromagnetic radiation just happens to move this fast. Any particle that has no mass travels at c, without acceleration or any in between. The light that has released from a candle does not speed up until it reaches light speed, At the very instant of its creation, its speed is c. So why is c, the speed of light, finite then? Well, nobody knows. Our universe is just built this way. We don't have the smart answer here. So light is part of a spectrum, an elementary particle that also behaves like a wave, Propelled by two perpendicular fields, travelling at the speed limit of the universe. Okay, that's nice and all, but what about the crazy stuff about travelling at the speed of light, and time, the twin paradox, quantum stuff, things like that? We would have to save them for another video. For now, let's be happy that we've evolved eyes that pick up waves of information permeating the universe. Making us see things and put our existence into perspective."
QAa2O_8wBUQ,2015-08-06T12:49:29.000000,What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?,"Matter, as we know it; Atoms, stars and galaxies, planets and 
trees, rocks and us. This matter accounts for less than
5% of the known universe. About 25% is dark matter; 
and 70% is dark energy. Both of which are invisible. This is kind of strange because it
suggests that everything we experience is really only a tiny fraction of reality. But it gets worse. We really have no clue what dark matter
and energy are, or how they work. We are pretty sure they exist though. So, what do we know? Dark matter is the stuff that makes 
it possible for galaxies to exist. When we calculated why the universe
is structured the way it is, it quickly became clear that there's just
not enough normal matter. The gravity of the visible matter
is not strong enough to form galaxies and complex structures. The stars would more likely be scattered
all over the place and not form galaxies. So, we know there is something else inside
and around them. Something that doesn't
emit or reflect light. Something dark... but besides being able to calculate
the existence of dark matter, we can see it... kind of. Places with a high concentration of dark
matter bend light passing near by. So we know there's something there that
interacts with gravity. Right now, we have more ideas about
what dark energy is not, than what it is! We know dark matter is not just clouds of
normal matter without stars, because it would emit particles
we could detect. Dark matter is not anti-matter, because anti-matter produces unique gamma
rays when it reacts with normal matter. Dark matter is also not
made up of black holes, very compact objects that violently affect
their surroundings, while dark matter seems to be
scattered all over the place. Basically, we only know 3 things for sure; 1. Something is out there. 2. It interacts with gravity. 3. There is a lot of it. Dark matter is probably made up of a 
complicated exotic particle that doesn't interact with 
light and matter in a way we expect, but right now, we just don't know. Dark energy is even more
strange and mysterious. We can't detect it, we can't measure it
and we can't taste it. But we do see its effects very clearly. In 1929, Edward Hubble examined how 
the wavelength of light emitted by distant galaxies, shifts
towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum
as it travels through the space. He found that fainter, more distant galaxies
showed a large degree of red shift; closer galaxies, not so much. Hubble determined that this was because
the universe itself is expanding. The red shift occurs,
because the wavelengths of light are stretched as the universe expands. More recent discoveries have shown that, 
the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Before that, it was thougth that the pull
of gravity would cause the expansion to either slow down or even retract and 
collapse in on itself at some point. Space doesn't change its properties
as it expands; there's just more of it. New space is constantly
created everywhere, galaxies are tight bound clusters of stuff
held together by gravity so we don't experience this expansion
in our daily lives. But we see it everywhere around us. Wherever there is empty space in the 
universe, more is forming every second. So, dark energy seems to be some
kind of energy intrinsic to empty space. Energy that is stronger than
anything else we know and it keeps getting stronger
as time passes by. Empty space has more energy than
everything else in the universe combined. We have multiple ideas about 
what dark energy might be. One idea is, the dark energy is not
a thing, but just a property of space. Empty space is not nothing, it has its own
energy. It can generate more space and
is quite active. So, as the universe expands,
it could be that just more and more space appears to fill the gaps and this leads
to a faster expanding universe. This idea is close to an idea that 
Einstein had back in 1917, of the concept of a cosmological constant, a force that counteracted
the force of gravity. The only problem is, that when we tried
to calculate the amount of this energy the result was so wrong and weird,
that it only added to the confusion. Another idea is, that empty space is
actually full of temporary, virtual particles that 
spontaneously and continually form from nothing and then dissapear into
nothing again. The energy form those particles
could be dark energy. Or maybe dark energy is an unknown kind of
dynamic energy fluid or field which permeates the entire universe,
but somehow has the opposite effect on the universe than normal
energy and matter. But if it exists, we don't know
how and where or how we could detect it. So there are still a lot of questions to
answer. Our theories about dark matter and
dark energy are still just that; theories. On one hand, this is kind of frustrating,
on the other hand this is frontier science making it very exciting. It shows us that no matter how much
we feel we're on top of things, we are still very much
apes with smartphones, on a tiny fragile island in space looking into
the sky wondering how our universe works There is so much left to learn,
and that is awesome. This video is supported by the

8nHBGFKLHZQ,2015-07-16T13:21:45.000000,What if there was a black hole in your pocket?,"What would happen to you if
a black hole the size of a coin suddenly appeared near you? Short answer: you’d die. Long answer: it depends. Is it a black hole with
the mass of a coin, or is it as wide as a coin? Suppose a US nickel with
the mass of about 5 grams magically collapsed into a black hole. This black hole would have a radius
of about 10 to the power of −30 meters. By comparison, a hydrogen atom is about
10 to the power of −11 meters. So the black hole compared
to an atom is as small as an atom compared to the Sun. Unimaginably small! And a small black hole would also have
an unimaginably short lifetime to decay by Hawking radiation. It would radiate away what little mass it
has in 10 to the power of −23 seconds. Its 5 grams of mass will be converted
to 450 terajoules of energy, which will lead to an explosion
roughly 3 times bigger than the atomic bombs dropped on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. In this case, you die. You also lose the coin. If the black hole had the
diameter of a common coin, then it would be considerably
more massive. In fact, a black hole with
the diameter of a nickel would be slightly more
massive than the Earth. It would have a surface gravity
a billion billion times greater than our planet currently does. Its tidal forces on you would be so strong that they’d rip your
individual cells apart. The black hole would consume you before
you even realized what’s happening. Although the laws of gravity
are still the same, the phenomenon of gravity that you’d
experience would be very different around such dense objects. The range of the gravitational attraction extends over the entire
observable universe, with gravity getting weaker the farther
away you are from something. On Earth right now, your head and your
toes are approximately the same distance from the center of our planet. But if you stood on
a nickel-sized black hole, your feet would be hundreds
of times closer to the center, and the gravitational force would be
tens of thousands of times as large as the force on your head and
rip you into a billion pieces. But the black hole wouldn’t
stop with just you. The black hole is now a
dominant gravitational piece of the
Earth–Moon–Black-Hole-of-Death system. You might think that the black hole would
sink towards the center of the planet and consume it from the inside out. In fact, the Earth also moves up onto
the black hole and begins to bob around, as if it were orbiting the black hole, all while having swathes of
mass eaten with each pass, which is much more creepy. As the Earth is eaten up from the inside, it collapses into a
scattered disk of hot rock, surrounding the black hole
in a tight orbit. The black hole slowly doubles its mass
by the time it’s done feeding. The Moon’s orbit is now highly elliptical. The effects on the Solar system
are awesome— in the Biblical sense of awesome,
which means terrifying. Tidal forces from the black hole would
probably disrupt the near-Earth asteroids, maybe even parts of the asteroid belt, sending rocks careening
through the Solar system. Bombardment and impacts
may become commonplace for the next few million years. The planets are slightly perturbed, but
stay approximately in the same orbit. The black hole we used
to call Earth will now continue on orbiting
the Sun in the Earth’s place. In this case, you also die. This bonus video was made possible

GqA42M4RtxE,2015-07-09T12:56:13.000000,"The Death Of Bees Explained – Parasites, Poison and Humans","Human society is extremely
complex and fragile, built upon various pillars. One of them is the honey bee. One out of three meals eaten by humans
is made possible by honey bees. They are so important that if all the
honey bees were to die out, thousands of plants would follow, which could lead to millions of people
starving in the following years. On top of that, honey bees have
a huge economic impact. The dollar value of plants
pollinated by them each year is around $265 billion. Food we take for granted would just
stop existing without them, or there would be a massive
decrease in productivity. Food including apples, onions, pumpkins,
and also plants used for feeding livestock and thus extremely important
for our milk and meat. Einstein is often quoted as having said, “If honey bees die out, humans
will follow a few years later.” Actually, he probably didn’t say that, but there might be some
truth in the statement. It’s unsettling, but honey bees
have started to disappear. Millions of hives have died
in the last few years. Beekeepers all over the world have seen an
annual loss of 30–90% of their colonies. In the US alone, bees
are steadily declining. >From 5 million hives in 1988
to 2.5 million today. Since 2006, a phenomenon called
“colony collapse disorder” has affected honey bees in many countries. And we’re not entirely sure
what’s causing it. All we know is that it’s pretty serious. Over the last few decades bees have seen
an invasion of very dangerous foes. Parasites straight out of a horror movie,
like Acarapis woodi, microscopic mites that infect the tracheae
(that’s the breathing tubes) of bees. Here, they lay their eggs and feed from
the fluids of their victims, weakening them considerably and spending
their whole life inside the bees. Or Varroa destructor, a fitting name
because they can only reproduce in honey bee hives and are one of
the bees’ greatest enemies. The female mite enters a honey bee brood
cell and lays eggs on the bee larva before it’s about to pupate and before the hive bees cover the
cell with a wax capping. The eggs hatch and the young mites and
their mother feed on the developing bee in the safety of the capped cell. The bee is not normally killed
at this stage, just weakened, so it still has enough strength to chew
its way through the wax capping and release itself from the cell. As it does, it releases the mother mite
and her new offspring from the cell, and these are free to
spread across the hive, starting the process over again
in a cycle of about 10 days. Their numbers grow exponentially,
and after a few months, this can lead to the collapse
of the entire bee hive. Once outside of the cell, adult mites
also suck the bodily fludis of bees and weaken them considerably. To make things worse, they also transmit
viruses that harm the bees even more and can lead to birth defects
like useless wings. But there are other threats too,
such as viruses and fungi. Under normal circumstances, these
phenomena should be manageable and are not enough to explain the horrendous amount of
dying going on in bees. Over recent years new insecticides
have been introduced that are deadly to bees. Neonicotinoids, a chemical family
similar to nicotine, was approved in the early 1990s
as an alternative to chemicals like DDT. They attack insects by harming
their nervous systems. Today, they are the most widely
used insecticides in the world. Globally, they saw sales
of €1.5 billion in 2008, representing 24% of the global
market for insecticides. In 2013, neonicotinoids were used in the
US on about 95% of corn and canola crops, and also on the vast majority
of fruit and vegetables, like apples, cherries, peaches, oranges,
berries, leafy greens, tomatoes, potatoes, cereal grains, rice, nuts,
grapes, and many more. Bees come into contact with the toxin while collecting pollen or
via contaminated water, often bringing material into the hive, where it can accumulate and
slowly kill the whole colony. The toxins harm bees in a
variety of horrible ways. In high enough doses, it quickly leads
to convulsions, paralysis, and death. But even in small doses, it can be fatal. It may lead to bees forgetting
how to navigate the world, so bees fly into the wild, get lost, and
die alone, separated from their hives. If this happens often enough, a hive
can lose its ability to sustain itself. We know that neonicotinoids
are harmful to bees and that we urgently need
an alternative to it, but there are billions of dollars
to be made in delaying this. Studies sponsored by the chemical
industry magically appear to prove a much lower toxicity to bees, compared to
those produced by independent scientists. There are even more factors
contributing to the demise of bees, like too much genetic uniformity,
crop monocultures, poor nutrition due to overcrowding,
stress because of human activities, and other pesticides. Each of those factors on its own is
a major problem for bees, but together, they probably account
for colony collapse disorder. With parasites upping their
game in recent decades, the honey bees are now
fighting for survival. It would be a catastrophe
if they lost this fight. This is a conundrum we have to solve
if we want to continue living with a relative abundance
and diversity of food. Humanity is deeply interconnected with
Earth and the other lifeforms on it, even if we pretend that we’re not. We have to take better care
of our surroundings, if not to preserve the beauty of nature,
then at least to ensure our own survival. This video is supported by the

1fQkVqno-uI,2015-06-04T12:42:46.000000,The Fermi Paradox II — Solutions and Ideas – Where Are All The Aliens?,"There are probably 10,000 stars for every grain of sand on Earth, in the observable universe. We know that there might be trillions of planets. So where are all the aliens? This is the Fermi Paradox. If you want to know more about it, watch part one. Here we look at possible solutions to the Fermi Paradox. So will we be destroyed or does a glorious future await us? Space travel is hard. Although possible, it's an enormous challenge to travel to other stars. Massive amounts of materials have to be put into orbit and assembled. A journey of maybe thousands of years needs to be survived by a population big enough to start from scratch. And the planet might be not as hospitable as it seems from afar. It was already extremely hard to set up a spaceship that could survive the trip. An interstellar invasion might be impossible to pull off. Also, consider time: the Universe is very old. On Earth there's been life for at least 3.6 billion years. Intelligent human life for about 250,000 years. But only for about a century have we had the technology to communicate over great distances. There might have been grand alien empires that stretched across thousands of systems and existed for millions of years and we might just have missed them. There might be grandiose ruins rotting away on distant worlds. 99% of all species on Earth have died out. It's easy to argue that this will be our fate sooner or later. Intelligent life may develop, spread over a few systems and die off, over and over again. But galactic civilizations might never meet. So maybe it's a unifying experience for life in the Universe to look at the stars and wonder ""Where is everyone?"" But there is no reason to assume aliens are like us, or that our logic applies to them. It might just be that our means of communication are extremely primitive and outdated. Imagine sitting in a house with a Morse code transmitter: you'd keep sending messages but nobody would answer, and you would feel pretty lonely. Maybe we're still undetectable for intelligent species and we'll remain so until we learn to communicate properly. And even if we met aliens we might be too different to be able to communicate with them in a meaningful way. Imagine the smartest squirrel you can, no matter how hard you try, you won't be able to explain our society to it. After all, from the squirrel's perspective, a tree is all that a sophisticated intelligence like itself needs to survive. So humans cutting down whole forests is madness; but we don't destroy forests because we hate squirrels. We just want the resources. The squirrel's wishes and the squirrel's survival are of no concern to us. A Type 3 civilization in need of resources may treat us in a similar way. They might just evaporate our oceans to make collecting whatever they need easier. One of the aliens might think for a second ""Oh, tiny little apes! They built really cute concrete structures, oh well now they're dead."" before activating warp speed. But if there is a civilization out there that wants to eliminate other species, it's far more likely that it will be motivated by culture rather than by economics. And anyway it will be more effective to automate the process by constructing the perfect weapon, a self replicating space probe made from nano-machines. They operate on a molecular level: incredibly fast and deadly, with the power to attack and dismantle anything in an instant. You only need to give them four instructions. One, find a planet with life. Two, disassemble everything on this planet into its component parts. Three, use the resources to build new space probes. Four, repeat. A doomsday machine like this could render a galaxy sterile in a few million years. But why would you fly light years to gather resources or commit genocide? The speed of light is actually... not very fast. If someone could travel at the speed of light, it will still take 100,000 years to cross the milky way once, and you'll probably travel way slower. There might be way more enjoyable things than destroying civilizations and building empires. An interesting concept is the Matrioshka Brain. A mega-structure surrounding a star, a computer of such computing power that an entire species could upload their consciousness and exist in a simulated universe. Potentially, one could experience an eternity of pure ecstasies without ever being bored or sad, a perfect life. If built around a red dwarf, this computer could be powered for up to ten trillion years. Who would want to conquer the galaxy or make contact with other life forms, if this were an option? All these solutions to the Fermi Paradox have one problem. We don't know where the borders of technology are. We could be close to the limit or nowhere near it. And super technology awaits us, granting us immortality, transporting us to other galaxies, elevating us to the level of gods. One thing we do have to acknowledge is that we really don't know anything. Humans have spent more than 90% of their existence as hunter-gatherers. 500 years ago we thought we were the center of the universe. 200 years ago we stopped using human labors as the main source of the energy. 30 years ago we had apocalyptic weapons pointed at each other because of political disagreements. In the galactic time scale we are embryos. We've come far, but still have a long way to go. The mindset that we really are the center of the universe is still strong in humans, so it's easy to make arrogant assumptions about life in the universe. But in the end, there's only one way to find out, right? Hey, everybody! We finally have our own subreddit. Come by for surveys, discussions about future videos, FAQs, and stuff like that.

sNhhvQGsMEc,2015-05-06T12:55:55.000000,The Fermi Paradox — Where Are All The Aliens? (1/2),are we the only living things in the entire universe the observable universe is about 90 billion light years in diameter there are at least 100 billion galaxies each with 100 to 1 000 billion stars recently we've learned that planets are very common too and there are probably trillions and trillions of habitable planets in the universe which means there should be lots of opportunity for life to develop and exist right but where is it shouldn't the universe be teeming with spaceships let's take a step back [Music] even if there are alien civilizations in other galaxies there's no way we'll ever know about them basically everything outside of our direct galactic neighborhood the so-called local group is pretty much out of our reach forever because of the expansion of the universe even if we had really fast spaceships it would literally take billions of years to reach these places traveling through the emptiest areas in the universe so let's focus on the milky way the milky way is our home galaxy it consists of up to 400 billion stars that's a lot of stars counting one per second it would take you a hundred lifetimes to count them all there are about 20 billion sun-like stars in the milky way and estimates suggest that a fifth of them have an earth-sized planet in its habitable zone the area with conditions that enable life to exist if only 0.1 of those planets harbored life there would be one million planets with life in the milky way but wait there's more the milky way is about 13 billion years old in the beginning it would not have been a good place for life because things exploded a lot but after one to two billion years the first habitable planets were born earth is only 4 billion years old so there have probably been trillions of chances for life to develop on other planets in the past if only a single one of them had developed into a space traveling super civilization we would have noticed by now what would such a civilization look like there are three categories a type 1 civilization would be able to access the whole energy available on its planet in case you're wondering we're currently around 0.73 on the scale and we should reach type 1 sometime in the next couple of hundred years type 2 would be a civilization capable of harnessing all of the energy of its home style this would require some serious science fiction but it is doable in principle concepts like the dyson sphere a giant complex surrounding the sun would be conceivable type 3 is a civilization that basically controls its whole galaxy and its energy an alien race this advance would probably be god-like to us but why should we be able to see such an alien civilization in the first place if we were to build generation spaceships that could sustain a population for around 1 000 years we could colonize the whole galaxy in 2 million years sounds like a long time but remember the milky way is huge so if it takes a couple of million years to colonize the entire galaxy and there are possibly millions if not billions of planets that sustain life in the milky way and these other life forms have had considerably more time than we've had then where are all the aliens this is the fermi paradox and nobody has an answer to it but we do have some ideas let's talk about filters a filter in this context represents a barrier that is really hard for life to overcome they come in various degrees of scary one there are great filters and we have passed them maybe it is way harder for complex life to develop than we think the process allowing life to begin hasn't yet been completely figured out and the conditions required may be really complicated maybe in the past the universe was way more hostile and only recently have things cooled down to make complex life possible this would also mean that we may be unique or at least one of the first if not the first civilization in the entire universe two there are great filters and they are ahead of us this one would be really really bad maybe life on our level exists everywhere in the universe but it gets destroyed when it reaches a certain point a point that lies ahead of us for example awesome future technology exists but when activated it destroys the planet the last words of every advanced civilization would be this new device will solve all of our problems once i push this button if this is true then we are closer to the end than the beginning of human existence or maybe there is an ancient type 3 civilization that monitors the universe and once a civilization is advanced enough it gets eliminated in an instant maybe there is something out there that it would be better not to discover there is no way for us to know one final thought maybe we're alone right now we have no evidence that there's any life besides us nothing the universe appears to be empty and dead no one's sending us messages no one answering our calls we may be completely alone trapped on a tiny moist mud wall in an eternal universe does that thought scare you if it does you're having the correct emotional reaction if we let life on this planet die perhaps there will be no life left in the universe life will be gone maybe forever if this is the case we just have to venture to the stars and become the first type 3 civilization to keep the delicate flame of life existing and to spread it until the universe breathes its final breath and vanishes into oblivion the universe is too beautiful not to be experienced by someone [Music] this video was made possible by your support it takes at least 200

pVbLlnmxIbY,2015-04-01T12:19:49.000000,3 Reasons Why Nuclear Energy Is Awesome! 3/3,"Three reasons why we should continue
using nuclear energy. One: nuclear energy saves lives. In 2013, a study conducted by NASA found
that nuclear energy has prevented around 1.8 million deaths. Even if you include the death tolls from
Chernobyl and Fukushima, nuclear energy ranks last in death per
energy unit produced. While nuclear waste is really toxic,
it’s usually stored somewhere, while the toxic byproducts of fossil fuels
are pumped into the air we breathe every day. So, just by reducing the amount of fossil
fuels burned, countless cases of cancer or lung disease and accidents in
coal mines have been avoided. If we can choose between lots of dangerous
stuff being put into a deep hole and lots and lots and lots of dangerous stuff
being pumped into the atmosphere, the former seems more logical. Nuclear energy feels way
more dangerous, though. Single catastrophic events burn into our
memory, while coal and oil kill silently. It’s like the death rate of
flying versus driving. Even in the best-case scenario, it would
take at least forty years to switch to 100%-renewable energy. So, for as long as we continue using
fossil fuels, nuclear energy will save way more lives than it destroys. Two: nuclear energy reduces CO₂ emissions. Nuclear energy is arguably way less
harmful to the environment in terms of climate change than fossil
fuels, our main source of energy. Since 1976, about 64 gigatons of
greenhouse gas emissions have not been pumped out thanks
to nuclear energy. And by the mid-21st century, that could
amount to an additional 80–240 gigatons. Humanity’s energy consumption is
rising steadily. According to US government projections,
China alone will add the equivalent of a new 600-MW coal plant every 10 days
for the next 10 years. China already burns 4 billion tons of
coal each year. Coal is cheap, relatively abundant, and
easy to get to. So it’s not likely that humanity will stop
using it soon. Nuclear energy might be the only way of
dampening the effects of climate change and preventing a catastrophic man-made
global warming. Compared to the other things we do,
nuclear energy is relatively clean. So, even if it is a good idea to quit
nuclear energy long-term, it might be a good solution for
the next hundred years or so, compared to the alternatives. Three: new technologies. Maybe technology will solve the problem of
nuclear waste and dangerous power plants. The nuclear reactors we’ve used so far are
mostly outdated technology, because nuclear innovation
stopped in the 1970s. There are models, like the
thorium reactor, that could solve the problem altogether. Thorium is abundant, really hard to turn
into nuclear weapons, and up to two orders of magnitude less
wasteful than current nuclear reactors. The waste material might also be only
dangerous for a few hundred years, in contrast to a couple of thousand years. 1 ton of thorium is estimated to provide
the same amount of energy as 200 tons of uranium or
3.5 million tons of coal. So while we cannot know for sure if
alternative nuclear technology will keep its promises, shouldn’t we at
least do more research before we forego an opportunity to solve
lots of humanity’s current problems? It may not be an easy challenge,
but that hasn’t stopped us before. So, should we use nuclear energy? There are risks involved in any great
human endeavor, and we have to make an informed decision,
rather than rely on gut feeling. If you want to hear the other
side of the argument, or a short introduction to
nuclear energy, click here."
HEYbgyL5n1g,2015-04-01T12:19:54.000000,3 Reasons Why Nuclear Energy Is Terrible! 2/3,"three reasons why we should stop using
nuclear energy one. nuclear weapons proliferation nuclear technology made a violent
entrance onto the world stage just one year after the world's
first-ever nuclear test explosion in 1944 two large cities were destroyed by just
two single bombs after that, reactor technology slowly
evolved as a means of generating electricity but it's always been
intimately connected with nuclear weapons technology it's nearly impossible to develop
nuclear weapons without access to reactor technology in fact the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty serves the purpose of spreading nuclear reactor technology without spreading nuclear weapons, with
limited success in forty years five countries have
developed their own weapons with the help of reactor technology the fact of the matter is that it can be
very hard to distinguish a covert nuclear weapons program from
the peaceful use of nuclear energy in the nineteen seventies the big
nuclear powers were happily selling peaceful technology to smaller countries
which then developed weapons of their own the road to deadly nuclear weapons is
always paved with peaceful reactors 2. nuclear waste and pollution spent
nuclear fuel is not only radioactive but also contains extremely poisonous
chemical elements like plutonium it loses its harmfulness only slowly over
several tens of thousands of years and there is also a process called re
processing which means the extraction of plutonium
from spent nuclear fuel it can be used for two purposes: to build
nuclear weapons or to use it as new fuel, but hardly
any of it is used as fuel because we don't have the right kind of
reactors for that, a milligram will kill you a few kilograms make an
atomic bomb and even an inconspicuous country like Germany literally has tons of the stuff just
lying around because re processing sounded like a good idea decades ago and Where will all the waste go? after dumping it into
the ocean was forbidden we've tried to bury it, but we can't find
a place where it will definitely stay secure for tens of thousands of years over 30 countries operate nearly 400
reactors managing several hundred thousands of
tons of nuclear waste and only one is currently serious about
opening a permanent civilian waste storage: tiny
Finland 3. accidents and disasters over sixty years of nuclear power usage
there have been seven major accidents in reactors or facilities dealing with nuclear waste
three of those were mostly contained but four of them released significant amounts
of radioactivity into the environment in 1957, 1987 and 2011 large areas of land in Russia Ukraine
and Japan Were rendered unfit for human habitation for
decades to come the number of deaths is highly disputed
But probably lies in the thousands these disasters happened with nuclear
reactors of very different types in very different countries and several
decades apart looking at the numbers we may as well
ask ourselves: are 10 percent of the world's energy supply worth a devastating disaster every 30
years? would thirty percent be worth another
Fukushima or chernobyl somewhere on earth every 10 years? what area would have to
be contaminated so we say no more? where is the line? so should we use nuclear energy? the risks may outweigh the benefits and
maybe we should stop looking into this direction and drop this technology for good if you
want to hear the other side of the argument"
rcOFV4y5z8c,2015-03-26T13:24:03.000000,Nuclear Energy Explained: How does it work? 1/3,"Have you ever been in an argument
about nuclear power? We have, and we found it
frustrating and confusing, so let’s try and get to grips
with this topic. [Intro] It all started in the 1940s. After the shock and horror of the war
and the use of the atomic bomb, nuclear energy promised to be a peaceful
spin-off of the new technology, helping the world get back on its feet. Everyone’s imagination was running wild. Would electricity become free? Could nuclear power help
settle the Antarctic? Would there be nuclear-powered cars,
planes, or houses? It seemed that this was just a few
years of hard work away. One thing was certain: the future
was atomic. Just a few years later, there was a sort
of atomic age hangover; as it turned out, nuclear power was very
complicated and very expensive. Turning physics into engineering
was easy on paper, but hard in real life. Also, private companies thought that
nuclear power was much too risky as an investment; most of them would much
rather stick with gas, coal, and oil. But there were many people who
didn’t just want to abandon the promise of the atomic age;
an exciting new technology, the prospect of enormously
cheap electricity, the prospect of being independent
of oil and gas imports, and, in some cases, a secret desire to
possess atomic weapons provided a strong motivation
to keep going. Nuclear power’s finest hour finally came
in the early 1970s, when war in the Middle East caused oil prices
to skyrocket worldwide. Now, commercial interest and investment
picked up at a dazzling pace. More than half of all the nuclear reactors
in the world were built between 1970 and 1985. But which type of reactor to build,
given how many different types there were to choose from? A surprising underdog candidate
won the day: the light water reactor. It wasn’t very innovative, and it wasn’t
too popular with scientists, but it had some decisive advantages: it was there, it worked, and it wasn’t
terribly expensive. So, what does a light water reactor do? Well, the basic principle is shockingly
simple: it heats up water using an artificial
chain reaction. Nuclear fission releases several million
times more energy than any chemical reaction could. Really heavy elements on the brink of
stability, like uranium-235, get bombarded with neutrons. The neutron is absorbed, but the result
is unstable. Most of the time, it immediately splits
into fast-moving lighter elements, some additional free neutrons, and
energy in the form of radiation. The radiation heats the surrounding water, while the neutrons repeat the process with other atoms, releasing more neutrons and radiation in a closely controlled chain reaction. Very different from the fast, destructive runaway reaction in an atomic bomb. In our light water reactor, a moderator
is needed to control the neutrons’ energy. Simple, ordinary water does the job, which
is very practical, since water’s used to drive the turbines anyway. The light water reactor became prevalent
because it’s simple and cheap. However, it’s neither the safest, most
efficient, nor technically elegant nuclear reactor. The renewed nuclear hype lasted barely
a decade, though; in 1979, the Three Mile Island nuclear
plant in Pennsylvania barely escaped a catastrophe when
its core melted. In 1986, the Chernobyl catastrophe
directly threatened Central Europe with a radioactive cloud, and in 2011
the drawn-out Fukushima disaster sparked new discussions and concerns. While in the 1980s 218 new nuclear power
reactors went live, their number and nuclear’s global share of
electricity production has stagnated since the end of the ’80s. So what’s the situation today? Today, nuclear energy meets around 10% of
the world’s energy demand. There are about 439 nuclear reactors
in 31 countries. About 70 new reactors are under
construction in 2015, most of them in countries
which are growing quickly. All in all, 116 new reactors are
planned worldwide. Most nuclear reactors were built more than
25 years ago with pretty old technology. More than 80% are various types of
light water reactor. Today, many countries are faced with
a choice: the expensive replacement of the aging reactors, possibly with more
efficient, but less tested models, or a move away from nuclear power towards
newer or older technology with different cost and environmental
impacts. So, should we use nuclear energy? The pro and contra arguments will be
presented here next week. Subscribe, and then you won’t miss it!"

Merchants from all over the continent met to trade their goods, but there was one problem: too many currencies in circulation. In Pisa, merchants had to deal with seven different types of coins and had to exchange their money constantly. This exchange business, which commonly took place outdoors benches, is where we get the word ""bank"" from; from the word ""banco"", Italian for ""bench"". The dangers of travelling, counterfeit money and the difficulty of getting a loan got people thinking. It was time for a new business model: home brokers started to give credit to businessmen, while genevese merchants developed cashless payments. Networks of banks spread all over Europe, handing out credit even to the church, or European kings. What about today ? In a nutshell, banks are in the risk management business. This is a simplified version of the way it works. People keep their money in banks and receive a small amout of interest. The bank takes this money, and lends it out at much higher interest rates. It's a calculated risk, because some of the lenders will default on their credit. This process is essential for our economic system, because it provides ressources for people to buy things like houses, or for industries to expand their businesses and grow. So banks take funds that are unused by savers, and turn them into funds society can use to do stuff. Other sources of income for banks include accepting saving deposits, the credit card business, buying and selling currencies, custodian business and cash management services. The main problem with banks nowadays is, that a lot of them have abandoned their traditional role as providers of long-time financial products, in favour of short-time gains that carry much higher risks. During the financial boom, most major banks adopted financial constructs that were barely comprehensable and did their own trading in habit to make fast money, and earn their executives and traders millions in bonuses. This was nothing short of gambling and damaged whole economies and societies. Like back in 2008, when banks like Leeman Brothers gave credit to basically anyone who wanted to buy a house, and thereby put the bank in an extremely dangerous risk position. This led to the collapse of the housing market in the US and parts of Europe, causing stock prices to plummet, which eventually led to a global banking crisis, and one of the largest financial crises in history. Hundreds of billions of dollars just evaporated. Millions of people lost their jobs and lots of money. Most of the world's major banks had to pay billions in fines and bankers became some of the least trusted professionals. The US government and the European Union had to put together huge bailout packages to purchase bad assets and stop the banks from going bankrupt. New regulations were put into force to govern the banking business, compulsary bank emergency funds were enforced to absorb shocks in the event of another financial crisis. But other pieces of tough new legislation were successfully blocked by the banking lobby. Today, other models of providing financing are gaining ground fast. Like new investment banks, that charge a yearly fee and do not get commissions on sales, thus providing the motivation to act in the motivation in the best interests of their clients. or credit unions - cooperative initiatives that were established in the 19th century to circumvent credit sharks. In a nutshell, they provide the same financial services as banks, but focus on shared value rather than profit maximisation. The self proclaimed goal is to help members create opportunities like starting small businesses, expanding farms or building family homes while investing back into communities. They are controlled by their members, who also elect the board of directors democratically. World wide, credit union systems vary significantly, ranging from a handfull of members to organisations with several billion US-Dollars and hundreds of thousands of members. The focus on benefits for their members impacts the risk credit unions are willing to take, which explains why credit unions, although also hurting, survived the last financial crisis way better than traditional banks. Not to forget the explosion of crowdfunding in recent years. Aside from making awesome video games possible, platforms arosed that enabled people to get loans from large groups of small investors, circumventing the bank as a middle man. But it also works for industry - lots of new technology companies started out on kickstarter or indiegogo. The funding individual gets the satisfaction of being part of a bigger thing, and can invest in ideas they believe in. While spreading the risk so widely, that, if the project fails, the damage is limited. And last but not least, micro credits. Lots of very small loans, mostly handed out in developping countries that help people escape poverty. People who were previously unable to get access to the money they needed to start a business, because they weren't deemed worth the time. Nowadays, the granting of micro-credits has evolved into a multi-billion dollar business. So, banking might not be up your street, but the banks' role of providing funds to people and businesses is crucial for our society and has to be done. Who will do it and how it will be done in the future is up for us to decide, though."
y0opgc1WoS4,2015-02-24T15:09:20.000000,Measles Explained — Vaccinate or Not?,"Recently there has been
a lot of talk about measles. What does measles actually do,
and should you vaccinate against it? Or is this just hysteria? Measles is a virus: a hull of proteins, RNA, plus some more proteins for reproduction. It cannot reproduce by itself;
it needs a host cell to do so. To understand measles, we have to
understand the immune system. You might already have seen the visual system we developed
to help here. Now, let’s focus on the parts of
the immune system relevant to measles. The measles virus enters humans
through the nose, mouth, or eyes. The measles infection starts in the lungs. Measles is especially good at infecting
the body’s first line of defence: macrophages, powerful guard cells
that protect the lungs from intruders. They enter a cell and take it over. The virus reprograms the cell and transforms it into a dangerous
virus production center. Once a cell is filled with viruses, they leave the crippled cell
and begin the cycle over again. But the immune system has
powerful weapons against virus infections: natural killer cells. These cells basically patrol the body
and check other cells for infections. If they find an infected cell,
they order it to commit suicide. This is so effective that for
the first 10 days or so, you will not even notice that
you’re infected with measles. And now, the reason why measles
is so powerful. After a period of fighting and dying, macrophages alert the brain of the
immune system: the dendritic cells. The job of the dendritic cells is
to collect samples of intruders, travel to the lymph nodes, and then activate the heavy weapons that eradicate the infection very fast
in a team effort. But the measles virus uses
a dreadful tactic. It infects the dendritic cells and uses them as a Trojan horse
to enter deeper into the body. The infected cells travel to the next 
lymph node to alert other immune cells. Once it arrives, the measles virus spreads around the
virgin T and B cells and infects them. It attacks the very system that
evolved to fight it. Now, things happen very fast. The lymph system spreads the virus
everywhere and it enters the bloodstream, infecting cells while traveling. Measles infects organs like the spleen, the liver, the intestines,
and, most importantly, the lungs. The symptoms range from a very high fever, headache, sickness,
bronchitis, and, of course, a rash. In the lungs, the immune system was
doing pretty okay. But now, millions of viruses
attack a second time and kill countless cells, wiping out
the defense systems. In this phase, you start coughing out
millions of measles viruses. Measles is so contagious at this stage, that if you meet someone
who isn’t vaccinated, there’s about a 90% chance
you’ll infect them. Without the protective army in the lungs,
other bacteria or viruses that would usually not stand a chance can
now enter the lungs and develop into harmful parallel infections that
can cause pneumonia, the most common way to
die from measles. Your body’s immune system is now
seriously wounded. Various protective systems are hurt
and disrupted. The virus spreads everywhere, infecting
the skin all over the body. The typical measles rash now
becomes visible. And in some cases, the measles virus reaches the brain and causes
a brain infection. If it does so, the chances of dying
are between 20 to 40 percent, and there may be long-term damage. But your body is far from giving
up at this stage, and it fights back agressively. Some dendritic cells survive
long enough to activate the anti-virus forces of the body. Plasma cells in the lymph nodes
start producing billions of antibodies, tiny proteins that mark infected cells
for destruction or clump the virus together. Killer T cells flood the body
and kill infected cells left and right. After 2 to 3 weeks, the body usually gets the upper hand and overwhelms
the infection. But the immune system is now
seriously weakened, and may take weeks or months to recover, leaving the body vulnerable
to other diseases. But, if you make it, you are now immune: the immune system remembers
the virus forever. Measles is no joke. Although 84% of all humans are
vaccinated against measles, 122,000 people died because
of the infection in 2014. Some people cannot get vaccinations, either because they’re too young,
because of chemotherapy or HIV, or because they’re allergic
to the vaccine. They need the rest of us to
stop the disease for them. The measles vaccination is
safe, cheap, and available. There are no benifits from having
measles at all. You don’t strengthen your immune
system and it’s not more natural. Most people who don’t vaccinate
only want the best for their children, which is honorable. But if you ask yourself, “Am I putting the life of my child
and other children at risk by not vaccinating against measles?” The sad answer is yes. Yes, you are. Let’s not play the blame game, though. Let’s work together and
eradicate this virus. Together, we can get rid of these
dreadful monsters and consign them to their rightful place:

_lNF3_30lUE,2015-01-20T15:33:09.000000,How Small Is An Atom? Spoiler: Very Small.,"Atoms are ridiculous and unbelievably
small. A single human hair is about as thick as 500,000 carbon atoms stacked
over each other. Look at your fist, it contains trillions
and trillions of atoms. If one atom in it were about as big as a
marble, how big would your fist be? Well… about the size of Earth.
Hm… still hard to imagine? Let’s try something different Look at your little finger. Imagine that its tip is as big as the
room you’re sitting in right now. Now fill the room with grains of rice. One rice corn represents one cell of your fingertip. Now let’s zoom in on the rice corn. And now, one cell is as big as the
room you’re in right now. Let’s fill it with rice again.
This is about the size of a protein. And now, let us fill all the empty spaces
between the rice corns with fine grains of sand. This is roughly how small atoms are. What is an atom made of? Let us just pretend that atoms look
like this for a minute to make it easier to understand. An atom consists of three
elementary particles: neutrons, protons and electrons. Protons and neutrons bind together and
form the atom core, held together by the strong interaction, one of the four fundamental forces in
the universe. They are made from quarks and
held together by gluons. Nobody knows exactly how small quarks are. We think they might literally be points,
like in geometry. Try to imagine them as being
zero-dimensional. We suspect that quarks and electrons are the most fundamental components
of matter in the universe. Electrons orbit the atom core. They
travel at a speed of about 2,200 km/s, fast enough to get around the Earth in
just over 18 seconds. Like quarks, we think electrons are
fundamental particles. 99.999999999999% of an atom’s volume is just empty space…
Except that it isn’t. What we perceive as emptiness is actually
a space filled by quantum fluctuations, fields that have potential energy and
build and dissolve spontaneously. These fluctuations have a fundamental
impact on how charged particles interact. But that’s a topic for another video. How much space do the core and
electrons actually fill? If you were to subtract all the spaces
between the atom cores from the Empire State Building,
it would be about as big as a rice corn. All the atoms of humanity would
fit in a teaspoon. There are extreme objects where states
like this actually exist. In a neutron star, atom cores are
compacted so densely that the mass of three Suns fits into an
object only a few kilometers wide. By the way, what do atoms look like? Well, kind of like this. Electrons are like a wave function and a
particle at the same time. We can calculate where an electron might
be at any given moment in time. These clouds of probability,
called orbitals, are where electrons might be
with a certainty of 95%. The probability of finding an electron
approaches 0 the further we get away from
the atom core, but it actually never is zero, which
means that, in theory, the electron of an atom could be on
the other side of the universe. Okay, wait a second. These strange thingies make up all
the matter in the universe. For many dozens of known elements, you don’t need many dozens of
elementary particles, just three. Take one proton and one electron,
and you have hydrogen. Add a proton and a neutron,
you have helium. Add a few more, you get carbon,
a few more, fluorine, even more, gold, and so on. And every atom of an element is the same: all hydrogen atoms in the universe,
for example, are the same; the hydrogen in your body is exactly
the same as the hydrogen in the Sun. Do you feel confused right now?
We certainly do! Nothing on this scale of the universe
makes any sense in our world, and we’ve not even begun talking about
quantum mechanics or the particle zoo, which are even stranger! Our model of atoms has changed a number
of times since we first conceived it, and the current one will certainly
not be the last. So let us support scientists and research and wait for the next wave of
mindboggling new information about this strange world that is the
basis for our existence. Subtitles by the Amara.org community"
Hug0rfFC_L8,2014-12-18T14:02:27.000000,The Ultimate Conspiracy Debunker,"The Internet is like a breeding ground for conspiracy theories. While some are juste stupid and funny, others promote ignorance and an unhealthy distrust. So we went to the Kurzgesagt lab and developed a foolproof system to destroy not all but a lot of conspiracy theories. It's really simple, just ask yourself: Does the theory affect really rich and powerful people? Is the answer yes? OK, then it's most likely... Not true. Let's test it on three examples. Number one: There is an easy cure for cancer but it's withheld because it would destroy the profits of pharma companies. Hmmm... Do really rich people die of cancer, like, I don't know, say the former CEO of Apple? Yes? There is no suppressed cure for cancer. Number two: Chemtrails, the theory that airplanes spray chimicals in the air for population control or some of the crazy reason. Do really powerful people breathe air? Do Obama or Putin breathe air? Yes? Chemtrails are not a thing. Number three: Apocalyptic conspiracy theories. The world will end soon because of the Antichrist, Mayas Aliens, someone says so. Do really rich and powerful people ignore the soon to be upon us and a very imminent apocalypse? Yes? The world will not end soon. This obviously doesn't works for every conspiracy theory out there But it does works for some of the most stupid ones. So the next time someone tries to convince you that the Illuminati put stuff in you water, just show him this video and maybe be a bit more selective about your friends on Facebook."
QOCaacO8wus,2014-12-11T14:40:48.000000,What Is Life? Is Death Real?,"Life is fundamentally different
from dead stuff—or is it? Physicist Erwin Schrödinger
defined life this way: Living things avoid decay into
disorder and equilibrium. What does this mean? Let’s pretend that your download
folder is the universe. It started orderly and got more
and more chaotic over time. By investing energy, you can create
order and clean it up. This is what living things do. But what is life? Every living thing on this
planet is made of cells. Basically, a cell is a protein-based robot
too small to feel or experience anything. It has the properties we just
assign to life: it has a wall that separates it from the
surroundings, creating order; it regulates itself and maintains
a constant state; it eats stuff to stay alive; it grows and develops; it reacts to the environment; and it’s subject to evolution; and it makes more of itself. But of all the stuff that makes up
a cell, no part is alive. Stuff reacts chemically with other stuff,
forming reactions that start other reactions which
start other reactions. In a single cell, every second several
million chemical reactions take place, forming a complex orchestra. A cell can build several thousand
types of protein: some very simple, some complex
micromachines. Imagine driving a car at 100 km/h while
constantly rebuilding every single part of it with stuff you collect
from the street. That is what cells do. But no part of the cell is alive;
everything is dead matter moved by the laws of the universe. So is life the aggregate of all these
reaction processes that are taking place? Eventually, every living thing will die. The goal of the whole process is to
prevent this by producing new entities; and by this, we mean DNA. Life is, in a way, just a lot of stuff
that carries genetic information around. Every living thing is subject to
evolution, and the DNA that develops the best living
thing around it will stay in the game. So, is DNA life, then? If you take DNA out of its hull,
it certainly is a very complex molecule, but it can’t do anything by itself. This is where viruses make everything
more complicated. They are basically strings of RNA
or DNA in a small hull and need cells to do something. We’re not sure if they count as
living or dead. And still, there are 225,000,000 m³
of viruses on Earth. They don’t seem to care what
we think of them. There are even viruses that invade
dead cells and reanimate them so they can be a host for them, which
blurs the line even more. Or mitochondria. They are the power plants of
most complex cells and were previously free living bacteria that
entered a partnership with bigger cells. They still have their own DNA and can
multiply on their own, but they are not alive anymore; they are dead. So they traded their own life for the
survival of their DNA, which means living things can evolve into
dead things as long as it’s beneficial to their genetic code. So, maybe life is information that manages
to ensure its continued existence. But what about AI
(artificial intelligence)? By our most common definitions, we are
very close to creating artificial life in computers. It’s just a question of time before the
technology we build gets there. And this is not science fiction, either; there are a lot of smart people
actively working on this. You could already argue that computer
viruses are alive. Hm, okay. So what is life, then? Things, processes, DNA, information? This got confusing very fast. One thing is for sure: the idea that life is fundamentally
different from non-living things because they contain some
non-physical element or are governed by different principles
than inanimate objects turned out to be wrong. Before Charles Darwin, humans drew a line
between themselves and the rest of living things; there was something
magical about us that made us special. Once we had to accept we are like every
living being, a product of evolution, we drew a different line. But the more we learn about what
computers can do and how life works, the closer we get to creating the first
machine that fits our desciption of life, the more our image of ourselves
is in danger again. And this will happen sooner or later. And here’s another question for you: if everything in the universe is made
of the same stuff, does this mean everything
in the universe is dead or that everything in the universe
is alive? That it’s just a question of complexity? Does this mean we can never die because we were never alive
in the first place? Is life and death an irrelevant question
and we haven’t noticed it yet? Is it possible we are much more part of
the universe around us than we thought? Don’t look at us; we don’t have any
answers for you. Just questions for you to think about. After all, it’s thinking about questions
like this that makes us feel alive and gives us some comfort. Subtitles by the Amara.org community"
sRv19gkZ4E0,2014-11-06T13:54:12.000000,The Ebola Virus Explained — How Your Body Fights For Survival,"What makes Ebola so dangerous? How can a virus overwhelm the very complex defense system of the body so quickly and so effectively? Let's take a look at what Ebola does. (Theme music) Ebola is a virus. A virus is a very small thing. A bit of RNA or DNA and a few proteins and a hull. It has no ability to do anything by itself whatsoever, and can only survive and proliferate by infecting cells. To avoid this we have the immune system. The immune system is super complex so we develop a visual system that makes it easy to understand. So it looks like this: Let's concentrate on the part that is critical to understanding Ebola and ignore the rest. So usually dendritic cells will activate the army of anti-virus cells, support cells and anti-body factories that work together with the guard cells wipe out the infection in a matter of days. But when Ebola strikes, it directly attacks the immune system. Some of the first cells it takes over are the dendritic cells, the brains of the immune system. The Ebola virus enters a dendritic cell by binding into receptors for cell transport. Once it is inside, it dissolves its outer hull and releases its genetic material, nucleoproteins and enzymes. In a nutshell it takes over the cell, disables the cells protective mechanisms and reprograms it. The cell now becomes a virus production machine and uses its resources to build Ebola viruses. Once the cell is saturated, it dissolves the cell membrane and millions of viruses are released into the tissue. The virus not only prevents the dendritic cells from activating the specialized and anti-virus forces, it manipulates them into sending signal proteins that tricks specialized cells into ending their own life's prematurely. So the immune system is seriously disrupted and unable to react. When the virus rapidly multiplies, we're talking billions, there are cells that should deal with infected cells, the natural killer cells, but they also get infected and just die before they can prevent the disease from spreading. At the same time Ebola infects the guard cells of the body macrophages and monocytes, not only managing to circumvent their defenses, it also manipulates some to signal to the cells make up the blood vessels telling into release fluid into the body Usually this makes sense, but in this case it just causes mayhem. All of the body's neutrophils are activated awaken by the virus and the macrophages signals then are not very effective against viruses and should not be involve in this fight and begin to do lots of stuffs they shouldn't do. The neutrophils signals to the blood vessels to release more fluid causing internal bleeding. Another area of the body Ebola attacks is the liver. The virus finds it very easy to enter the liver and it quickly starts killing loads of liver cells and causing organ failure and more internal bleeding. And all those things are going on at the same time. As the virus spreads, it's like nukes exploding every where. One incident of this in one region will be problem enough But now is starting to happen everywhere at once. All the mechanisms of the immune system have evolve to handle infections work against you. And the virus continues to spread and spread. And finally begins to infect more and more body cells while the body desperately struggles to stay alive. In a desperate last effort to turn the tide the immune system launches a cytokine storm. A cytokine storm is an S.O.S signal that causes the immune system to launch all of its weapons, all at once in a desperate kamikaze attack. This hurts the virus but leaves behind tons of collateral damage, Especially in the blood vessels. Paradoxically the healthier the immune system, the more damage it can do to itself More and more fluid leaves the blood stream. Blood pours after every opening of the body. You become seriously dehydrated that just not now blood left to supply the organs with oxygen and cells begin to die. If you reach this point the chance of you dying is very high. Currently six out of ten infected die from Ebola. Wow! Ok. Ebola is nasty. So it’s time to panic, right? No, not even close. The severity of Ebola gets paper sold and YouTube videos shared so everybody is talking about Ebola. But currently the only way to get infected by Ebola is to come into contact with the body fluids of a person who shows symptoms Or from infected bat. So just don’t do that. Ebola has killed 5,000 people since June 2014. The common flu kills up to 500,000 people each year. Malaria causes up to one million each year. 3,000 people every single day. Ten children since this video started. So even if Ebola is terrible and scary, don’t let yourself be scared. The most infectious thing about Ebola is the media hype around it. You could learn a bit more about the immune system though Transcription made by Miriam Delgado Subtitles by the Amara .org community Revised by: Ace Ervite"
NbuUW9i-mHs,2014-10-09T13:11:55.000000,Is War Over? — A Paradox Explained,"Violence and war. The insane brutality of ISIS continues, the Russians are invading Ukraine, and the Palestinians and Israelis continue to slug it out. Does that make you feel gloomy? Well don't. Because if you look at the numbers war actually seems to be going out of fashion, while the global population is at an all time high. It seems that we live in the most peaceful period in human history. How is this possible? (music) As of September 2014, there were 4 conflicts going on in the world that'd caused at least 10,000 people to die since January 2013. 9 conflicts that killed more than 1,000 people and 13 that killed more than 100 since January 2013. Not really peaceful, but consider this: of all the conflicts going on none is an active war between countries. They are either civil wars or local conflicts. Although civil wars are terrible and cause huge suffering, their impact is usually way smaller than a war between nations or empires. When two nations engage in war, they can mobilise much bigger forces, have access to all of the state's resources and logistics and almost all of the population. So why have we transitioned from wars between nation states wars between nation states A lot of it is to do with colonialism and the cold war. When the cold war ended, a major driver of armed conflicts vanished too. But the break up of the communist dictatorships revealed new or old tensions and brought new conflicts in the now freed states which often resulted in civil war. Much more importantly, in 1945, nearly all of Africa, much of Asia, and parts of Latin America were under colonial rule. By 1990, all but a few islands were independent. But wait. Couldn't you argue that what today's multinational corporations are doing in the third world is just as bad as colonialism? Let's look at Congo. It was established as a colony in 1885 by the Belgium king. An area 80 times the size of Belgium. Violence committed against the indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic exploitation had killed about half of the population by 1908. About 10 million Congolese were executed or starved to death. Millions were mutilated and traumatised. The economic exploitation of the Congo remained the top priority and forced labor never really ceased completely until the end of Belgium rule in 1960. Which is not really that long ago. So, no. Colonialism was much worse than vulture capitalism is today and it ended just two generations ago. Most of the conflicts that are going on right now are in areas that 60 years ago were under foreign control. But things are getting better. Until 1989, victory for one side in a civil war was common while nowadays victories are much rarer. At the same time, negotiated endings have jumped from 10% to almost 40%. What about the rest of the world? Why have nation states stopped attacking each other? There are 4 major reasons: One. Democratisation. The steady development from autocracy to democracy. Democracies hardly ever fight each other. Of all the state against state wars fought since 1900, only a minority were fought between democracies. Two. Globalisation. War is just not as effective at achieving economic goals as it used to be. Today it's almost always cheaper to buy resources on the global market than to cease them by force. People from other nations are more valuable to us alive than dead. Which, overall, is a pretty new concept. Three. War is so 20th century. Until World War I, warfare was seen as an inevitable part of the human experience and as a valuable tool which you could use to achieve goals when diplomacy hit a brick wall. Today we have rules that declare acts of aggression illegal and stipulate that armed forces is only justified in self-defence or with the authority of the UN Security Council. These rules are still broken but today it's harder to do so without sparking oppositions and disapproval. Also, we have an international court for war crimes in The Hague. And that's a very recent innovation. Four. Borders are mostly fixed now. After World War II, territorial wars generally stopped when most countries pledged to accept international borders and respect other nations autonomy. But is all of this just an anomaly or are we on the road to lasting peace? Truth is we don't know yet. We need a big enough sample to rule out the historical average, which is about one or two big wars per century. We just haven't had enough time since World War II to rule out the possibility that war is not going away. If we don't have one major war in the next 75 years, we can be really confident that humanity is changing. So you see, war might be over. Yes there are nasty conflicts going on in many places but overall, things are getting better. And we can make them even better by speaking up for peace and democracy.

ZW3aV7U-aik,2014-09-03T14:03:58.000000,Atoms As Big As Mountains — Neutron Stars Explained,"Neutron stars are one of the
most extreme things in the universe. They’re like giant atom cores. Kilometers in diameter,
unbelievably dense and violent. But how can something
like this even exist? The life of a star is dominated
by two forces being in balance. Its own gravity and the radiation
pressure of its fusion reaction. In the core of stars, hydrogen
is fused into helium. Eventually, the hydrogen
in the core is exhausted. If the star is massive enough,
helium is now fused into carbon. The cores of these massive
stars become layered like onions, as heavier and heavier atomic
nuclei build up at the center. Carbon is fused into neon, which leads
to oxygen, which leads to silicon. Eventually, the fusion reaction hits iron,
which cannot fuse into another element. When the fusion stops, the
radiation pressure drops rapidly. The star is no longer in balance, and if its core mass exceeds
about 1.4 solar masses, a catastrophic collapse takes place. The outer part of the core reaches
velocities of up to 70,000 km/s, as it collapses towards
the center of the star. Now, only the fundamental
forces inside an atom are left to fight the
gravitational collapse. The quantum-mechanical repulsion
of electrons is overcome, and electrons and protons
fuse into neutrons packed as densely as an atomic nucleus. The outer layers of the star
are catapulted into space in a violent supernova explosion. So, now we have a neutron star! Its mass is between 1 and 3 Suns, but compressed to an object
about 25 kilometers wide! And 500,000 times the mass
of Earth, in this tiny ball that’s roughly the diameter of Manhattan. It’s so dense that one cubic
centimeter of neutron star contains the same mass as an
iron cube 700 meters across. That’s roughly 1 billion tons,
as massive as Mount Everest, in a space the size of a sugar cube. Neutron star gravity
is pretty impressive too! If you were to drop an object from
1 meter over the surface, it would hit the star in one microsecond
and accelerate up to 7.2 million km/h. The surface is superflat, with
irregularities of 5 millimeters maximum, with a superthin atmosphere of hot plasma. The surface temperature
is about 1 million kelvin, compared to 5,800 kelvin for our Sun. Let’s look inside the neutron star! The crust is extremely hard
and is most likely made of an iron atom nuclei lattice with a sea
of electrons flowing through them. The closer we get to the core, the more
neutrons and the fewer protons we see until there’s just an incredibly dense
soup of indistinguishable neutrons. The cores of neutron stars
are very, very weird. We are not sure what their properties are,
but our closest guess is superfluid neutron degenerate matter or some kind of ultradense quark
matter called quark-gluon plasma. That does not make any sense
in the traditional way and can only exist in such an
ultraextreme environment. In many ways, a neutron star
is similar to a giant atom core. The most important difference is that atom
cores are held together by strong interaction
and neutron stars by gravity. As if all this wasn’t extreme enough, let’s take a look at
a few other properties. Neutron stars spin very, very fast,
young ones several times per second. And if there’s a poor star nearby
to feed the neutron star, it can rotate up to several
hundred times per second. Like the object PSRJ1748-2446ad. It spins at approximately
252 million km/h. This is so fast that the star has
a rather strange shape. We call these objects pulsars, because
they emit a strong radio signal. And the magnetic field of a neutron star is roughly 8 trillion times stronger
than the magnetic field of Earth. So strong that atoms get bent
when they enter its influence. Okay, I think we got the point across. Neutron stars are some
of the most extreme, but also some of the
coolest objects in the universe. Hopefully, we will one day send spaceships
to learn more about them and take some neat pictures! But we shouldn’t get too close! Subtitles by the Amara.org community"
JGXi_9A__Vc,2014-08-04T12:56:42.000000,Everything You Need to Know About Planet Earth,"Planet Earth is the home of every lifeform, known to us, in the universe. Its age is about 1/3 of the age of the universe and, admitted, It is a thing of beauty. a slightly squashed fair with a heavy metal core,  and a lighter surface crust,  wrapped in a thin sliver of sweet air to breathe, with vast oceans, fertile plains,  magnificent mountains,  fresh water rivers, streams, lakes and aquifers,  orbiting a star which warms us, and gives us energy. But how did our home come in to existence,  and what's it made of? 4.6 billion years ago,  Earth was created from the remnants of dead stars, that collected in a giant, dirty gas cloud. The gas cloud became denser in its center, and formed an accretion disk.  small particles started clumping together,  and building larger and larger objects,  until they form the objects we call ""Planets"" today. This process took 10 to 20 million years,  and is still not very well understood. At about this time, when the solar system was young and chaotic, a giant object, about as big as Mars, collided with our home. The impact was violent,  and if the object had been more massive, it might have destroyed Earth. Materials from Earth were smashed out into orbit, and formed the Moon, which is the biggest satellite in relation to its planet in the solar system. At this time, Earth was a hot hell, constantly being hit by asteroids,  with seas of lava,  and a toxic atmosphere. But something was about to change drastically. Earth cooled down. Water from the inside of the Earth wandered to the surface and rained down on Earth,  only to vaporize again and become clouds. Millions of asteroids brought more and more water to our planet. All the water on Earth has about this volume compared to Earth. Today,  the surface of Earth is 71% water,  and 29% land. 97.5% is saline water,  while only 2.5% is fresh water. The Fresh water is 69% ice and snow,  30% are ground waters,  and only about 1% make up the remaining ground waters. But even this small part is mostly frozen. Only a tiny part of our water is actually lakes and rivers. and an even tinier part is bound in living things. So, gradually the Earth cooled down,  and the surface formed a thin crust. But inside the earth, hot rock continue to swirl about,  moving the crust from below and breaking it apart. This process is called ""Plate Tectonics"",  and is happening right now. We'll make a whole video about it in the future. For now, let's just say that the crust of Earth consisted of separate giant plates that move around. As they meet, they crumble, and create mighty mountains. OR: violently plunge back down, deeper into Earth, creating deep trenches. That's the way the highest place on Earth was formed: Mt.Everest, and the deepest: the Mariana Trench. From our perspective,  Earth's mountains and trenches are mighty indeed,  but when you look at the Earth in cross-section, you can see how tiny they actually are. The part we stand on is the crust, which is about 50 kilometers thick, though it can vary between 5 and 70 kilometers  By the way, the deepest hole ever drilled by man is 12.262 kilometers deep. After the crust, comes the mantle. It's a silicate rocky shell,  and about 2,900 kilometers thick. The mantle consists of the upper mantle, and the lower mantle. The upper mantle has different regions, too. It's upper part, which is viscous and carries the crust, is called the ""Lithosphere."" After that, there comes the ""Asthenosphere,"" which consists of less mobile, mostly solid material. The lower mantle reaches deep down to the outer core of Earth. Earth's outer core is a liquid layer of iron and nickel,  about 2,266 kilometers thick. Temperatures vary from 4,000℃(7,232℉) to 5,700℃(10,292℉). And in the center, is the inner core. It's mostly solid,  a ball made of an iron-nickel alloy. with a radius of about 1,200 kilometers. 70% of the size of the moon,  and about the temperature of the surface of the Sun. It is slowly growing at an estimated rate of about 1mm/year. Now, for some respective, this small layer of crystallized melt products of former molten mantle, is where we live. Then, there's Earth's magnetic field. It's an invisible phenomenon that diverts high energy particles coming from the Sun and other sources, allowing for a stable environment with comparatively little radiation impact on Earth. But why is it there? Actually, we don't really know a terrible lot about that. We know, it has something to do with the core of Earth. Inside this metal sphere, large electrical currents flow in complicated patterns. They cause a magnetic field,  that sort of stabilizes itself according to the laws of electrodynamics. This entire system is called the ""Dynamo."" But, don't let us fool you into thinking we have it all figured out. Speaking of breathtaking information, what about the airy stuff that surrounds us? By volume, dry air consists mostly of Nitrogen,  Oxygen, Argon, Carbon, a variable mount of water vapor, and small amounts of other gases. Humans are very dependent on the lowest layer of the atmosphere:  the Troposphere - Where the weather is. It's 12 kilometers thick on average. Above that is the Stratosphere, which is where the ozone layer protects us from the sun's most aggressive type of light. Above that is the Mesosphere - the coolest place on Earth, with an average temperature around -85℃(-121℉). At about 80 kilometers up, the Thermosphere starts. The transition to space is a fluent one, without clear borders. but humans decided that space starts here. At about 100 kilometers, Earth stops, and space begins, though the atmosphere extends a bit further. In this region, we find the Ionosphere, the aurora borealis, and the ISS, and the outermost layer is the Exosphere, stretching up to 10,000 kilometers. It merges fluently with outer space, where there's no atmosphere at all. The atoms and molecules in this area are so far apart, that they can travel hundreds of kilometers  without colliding with each other. OK. Humans, in their present form, have only been around for 200,000 years. - that's 0.004% of Earth's history. Not long, really. And, here we are now, living in a thin, moist layer on a small, wet rock. We call this rock: Earth. It is the product of the universe's deepest workings, the result of a constant process of creation and destruction, happening all of the universe, all the time, helped by chance, the laws of the universe and random events, we are really lucky."
zQGOcOUBi6s,2014-07-01T16:06:05.000000,The Immune System Explained I – Bacteria Infection,"Every second of your life, you are under attack. Billions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi are trying to make you their home, so our bodies have developed a super complex little army with guards, soldiers, intelligence, weapons factories, and communicators to protect you from...well...dying. For this video, let's assume the immune system has 12 different jobs. For example, kill enemies, communicate, etc. And it has 21 different cells and 2 protein forces These cells have up to 4 different jobs. Let's assign them. Here are the interactions. Now, let's make this understandable. First of all, let's add colours to the jobs. Now, let's illustrate the cells. The central colour represents the main job of the cell, while the surrounding ones represent secondary duties. Now the immune system looks like this. Now the interactions. Isn't this complexity just awesome? For this video we will only talk about these cells and ignore the rest. So, what happens in the case of an infection? *Intro* It's a beautiful day, when suddenly, a wild rusty nail appears and you cut yourself. The first barrier of the immune system is breached: your skin. Nearby bacteria seize on the opportunity and enter your wound. They start using up the body's resources and double their numbers about every 20 minutes. At first, they fly under the radar, but when a certain bacteria population is reached, they change their behavior and start to damage the body by changing the environment around them. The immune system has to stop them as fast as possible. First of all, your guard cells, known as macrophages, intervene. They are huge cells that guard every border region of the body. Most of the time, they alone can suffocate an attack because they can devour up to 100 intruders each. They swallow the intruder whole and trap it inside a membrane. Then the enemy gets broken down by enzymes and is killed. On top of that, they cause inflammation by ordering the blood vessels to release water into the battlefield so fighting becomes easier. You notice this as a very mild swelling. When the macrophages fight for too long, they call in heavy backup by releasing messenger proteins that communicate location and urgency. Neutrophils leave their patrol routes in the blood and move to the battlefield. The neutrophils fight so furiously that they kill healthy cells in the process. On top of that, they generate barriers that trap and kill the bacteria. They are, indeed, so deadly that they evolved to commit suicide after five days to prevent them from causing too much damage. If this is not enough to stop the invasion, the brain of the immune system kicks in. The dendritic cell gets active. It reacts to the signals of the soldiers and starts collecting samples from the enemies. They rip them into pieces and present the parts on their outer layer. Now, the dendritic cell makes a crucial decision. Should they call for anti-virus forces that eradicate infected body cells or an army of bacteria killers? In this case, anti-bacteria forces are necessary. It then travels to the closest lymph node in about a day. Here, billions of helper and killer T cells are waiting to be activated. When T cells are born they go trough a difficult and complicated training process and only a quarter survives. The surviving cells are equipped with a specific set-up. And the denditric cell is on its way looking for a helper T cell with the set-up that's just right. It's looking for a helper T cell that can bind the parts of the intruders which the dendritic cell has presented on its membrane. When it finally finds one, a chain reaction takes place. The helper T cell is activated. It quickly duplicates thousands of times. Some become memory T cells that stay in the lymph node and will make you practically immune against this enemy. Some travel to the field of battle to help out. And the third group goes on to travel to the center of the lymph node to activate a very powerful weapons factory. Like the T cells, they are born with a specific set-up and when a B cell and a T cell with the same set-up meet, hell breaks loose. The B cell duplicates rapidly and starts producing millions of little weapons. They work so hard that they would literally die from exhaustion very fast. Here, helper T cells play another important role; they stimulate the hard working factories and tell them: ""Don't die yet, we still need you, keep going!"" This also ensures that the factories die if the infection is over so the body doesn't waste energy or hurt itself. But what is produced by the B cells? You've heard of them of course, antibodies. Little proteins that are engineered to bind to the surface of the specific intruder. There are even different kinds of antibodies that have slightly different jobs. The helper T cells tell the plasma cells which type is needed the most in this particular invasion. Millions of them flood the blood and saturate the body. Meanwhile, at the site of infection, the situation is getting dire. The intruders have multiplied in number and start hurting the body. Guard and attack cells fight hard, but also die in the process. Helper T cells support them by ordering them to be more aggressive and to stay alive longer. But without help they can't overwhelm the bacteria. But now, the second line of defense arrives. Billions of antibodies flood the battlefield and disable lots of the intruders, rendering them helpless or killing them in the process. They also stun the bacteria and make them an easy target. Their back is built to connect to killer cells, so they can connect and kill the enemy more easily. Macrophages are especially good at nomming up the bacteria which antibodies have attached to. Now the balance shifts. In a team effort, the infection is wiped out. At this point, millions of body cells have already died. No big deal, the losses are quickly replenished. Most immune cells are now useless and without the constant signals they commit suicide, so as not to waste any resources. But some stay behind: the memory cells. If this enemy is encountered ever again in the future, they will be ready for it and probably kill it before you even notice. This was a very, very simplified explanation of parts of the immune system at work. Can you imagine how complex this system is, even at this level, when we ignore so many players and all the chemistry. Life is awfully complicated, but if we take the time to understand it, we'll encounter endless wonders and great beauty."
AQPlREDW-Ro,2014-06-19T15:09:17.000000,"Iraq Explained -- ISIS, Syria and War","Oh dear… Just when you thought the Iraq
problem was solved because you haven’t heard about it
for a while, everything’s back to murderous
chaos and terror. What happened? In 2003, the US invaded Iraq because of
its alleged connections to terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. At the time, Saddam Hussein, a brutal
dictator, ruled the country. He was part of the Sunni minority and suppressed the Shia majority. Iraq was conquered fairly quickly, but the US had no plan for the country. The until-then suppressed Shia majority
took over and began oppressing the Sunnis, because suppressing other faiths has
proven to be such a good idea. Unsurprisingly, a Sunni rebel
uprising began and terrorist groups, like al-Qaeda,
trickled into Iraq and local forces, often former Sunni
military, began fighting the US troops and the newly
formed Iraqi state, peaking in a bloody civil war in 2006. Since then, people in Iraq have basically
been segregated by religion. So, in a tragic irony of history, the US
invasion led to the formation of the very terrorists the US wanted to
eliminate in the first place, because Iraq was now the perfect training
ground for terrorism. To understand this complicated conflict
better, we need to understand the relationship between the two main
branches of the Muslim faith: Shia and Sunni Islam. Sunnis make up about 80% of the Muslim
world and Shia about 20%. And the hard-liners on both sides don’t
like each other very much. Saudi Arabia and Iran are the two most
powerful players in the game of faiths. They both have no separation of state and
religion, domestic problems, and a lot of oil money. And they support groups that fight the
other religious orientation. And one of those terror organizations
supported by Saudi Arabia was the Islamic State in Iraq,
or ISI for short. In 2010, the Arab Spring happened and changed the whole situation
in the Middle East. In Syria, dictator Bashar al-Assad didn’t
think much of resigning and started a gruesome civil war
against his own people. The longer the war went on, the more
foreign groups joined the fight, most of them for religious reasons, and with the goal of building an
Islamic state in the region. And one of them was the infamous ISI,
which now became the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria,
or ISIS. They had fought in Iraq for years, and had thousands of well-trained and
fanatic soldiers. They already quasi-controlled parts of
northern Iraq and were very determined to build
their religious state. And they changed the game in Syria like
no-one expected. ISIS was so unbelievably violent and
radical that soon it was a war with almost every other faction of
the Syrian rebel armies. They attacked and killed member of other
Muslim terrorist groups. In the territories they controlled, they
built an Islamic state with rules so strict that even the
hard-liners of al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabia were shocked and withdrew their support. ISIS has been accused of responsibility
for multiple massacres against civilians, countless suicide bombings, the
hostage-taking of women and children, the execution of their prisoners, and
beheadings. All kinds of medieval hororrs we would
rather not have to illustrate. And this lovely gathering of human beings
recently decided it was time to take more territory in Iraq. Since the US left Iraq, the Shia prime
minister, Nouri al-Maliki, has monopolized power and discriminated
against Sunnis wherever possible. The government of Iraq is widely regarded
as being corrupt, incapable, and it’s cetainly hated by a large part
of its citizens. The Iraqi army, consisting of about
300,000 soldiers, was created using 25 billion US dollars in
tax money, but it’s not loyal to its government and has been withdrawing or completely
disbanding, giving up city after city. Because ISIS has announced that everyone
who opposes them will be killed, they have proven they mean business. By June 2014, they’d conquered a big
chunk of Iraq, including Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest
city. They’d stolen hundreds of millions from
captured banks, making them the richest terror
organization on Earth. And they are constantly working on
establishing a super-medieval religious state. Iran and the US are even considering
working together to fight them. That’s how gruesome the situation is. Events in Iraq show again that exploiting
the people you’ve defeated in a war, denying them power, a living, and a stake
in the rebuilding of the country is just sowing the seeds of the next bout
of violence. Somehow, we have to break this circle. Subtitles by the Amara.org community"
PKMQzkIiB0Y,2014-06-02T12:30:01.000000,Are You Alone? (In The Universe),"Are you alone in the universe? Or are you connected to anything? First of all, you’re part of a group of
mammals that’s still very young, but we can make YouTube
videos already, and build Large Hadron Colliders! We’ve also split the atom and
invented Pokémon. We stem from an ancient lifeform that began living about
three and a half billion years ago. We feel like we’re in control of this
planet, but we aren’t really. One little asteroid or one creative virus
is really all it would take to kill us off for good! Humanity credits itself with being
able to destroy the planet, but even with all our nuclear toys, we would probably just cause a
huge mass extinction, at best. Maybe we could kill 90% of
everything living on this planet. Big deal! A few million years later, life
would be back everywhere. Most microscopic life and
life below the surface wouldn’t even be disturbed
that much, probably. On a geological timescale,
our impact on Earth is kind of laughable. We’re actually not that powerful. We live on this tiny wet rock
that speeds through space following a massive ball of
burning plasma. One day, this ball of plasma
will stop burning and most likely kill us in the process. If we survive the death of the Sun
and colonize the galaxy, theoretically, we could survive until the last star in the universe goes out. After that, life becomes
pretty impossible. Okay, so everything has an end. Where does this leave you
as an individual? At one point in your life,
for about half an hour, you were only one single cell
inside your mother’s womb. A creature just 0.1 mm in diameter. Today, you consist of about
50 trillion cells. 50 trillion incredibly complex
little biological machines that are much bigger and more complex
than the average bacteria! They operate by the laws of
physics and chemistry and use micromachines to build proteins,
make energy usable, devour food, transport resources, transmit information,
or reproduce. They communicate, duplicate, commit
suicide, fight off intruders, and fulfil super-specialized duties for the
greater good of keeping you alive so you can have babies. But where is the “you” part in this, if
you’re made of trillions of little things? The basic information for “you”
is stored in the DNA, a molecule that encodes
the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning
of all known living things. If you were to unravel it,
it would be two meters long! If you combined all the little
DNA strings in all your cells, you’d get a string so long that it would
stretch to Pluto and back to Earth. That’s pretty long! And your DNA is a direct connection
to your very first ancestor. Take a second to think about this: in every cell of your body,
there’s a little string of stuff that’s been there in various forms
for 3.4 billion years. It evolved, it mutated, it
duplicated trillions of times, but it directly connects you to the
first living being on this planet. We could say you “touched” every living
being that came before you with your DNA. But you are more than your DNA. Your body is made of
seven octillion atoms. That’s seven billion billion billions. Roughly 93% of the mass the human body
is made up of just three elements: oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. Oxygen and hydrogen are predominantly
found in water, which makes up about 60%
of the body by weight. Carbon is, maybe, the most
important element for life. It can easily bond with other atoms,
which allows for the building of long complex chains of molecules,
which make up the solid part of you. The remaining 7% is a tour of
the periodic table of elements: nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, potassium,
sulfur, sodium, chlorine, magnesium, iron, fluorine, zinc, copper, iodine,
selenium, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, cobalt, lithium, strontium,
aluminum, silicon, lead, vanadium, arsenic, and bromine… phew! By the way, this also means
you’re about 0.5% metal, no matter what your favorite music is. Anyway, these elements perform
various functions like enabling oxygen transport,
building of bones and cell structures, carrying signals, driving chemical
reactions, and a lot more. Your body is in a constant
state of transition. Every 16 days, 75% of “you”
has been replaced, because a healthy human exchanges about
100% of their water in that time period. Each year, about 98% of your atoms are
replaced by new ones, and every 5 years, close to all of the
atoms that make up your body weren’t there five years ago. So, you could call yourself
a temporary collection of atoms. But where did these atoms come from? In the beginning of the universe, there
were mostly hydrogen and helium atoms. Enormous gas clouds formed over millenia
and grew denser and denser, until they collapsed under their own
gravity, giving birth to the first stars. In the cores of these stars, hydrogen was converted into helium
under extreme conditions. After millions of years, the
hydrogen became exhausted, and the stars began dying. Under super-extreme conditions,
all elements we know today were created a fraction of a second before
they died and exploded in supernovas. They shot most of their
contents into space, while the cores collapsed and
became black holes. All these elements traveled through space
for who knows how long. Until they arrived at a different cloud
that was slowly forming a new star— our Sun. These elements, that once
were the insides of a star, formed planets and found
their way onto Earth, where they enabled life to begin. So we are directly connected to
the first stars ever born in the universe. We are part of the universe. The idea of being a deeply connected
minuscule part of an enormous structure is really mindblowing. We don’t know what all this means,
or if it means anything at all. We know that we are made of little
parts that connect us to everything in the universe, to
the beginning of everything. Then this is kind of a nice thought: you are not alone; you never
were; you never will be. Subtitles by the Amara.org community"

are a strange bunch. Most of them are small 
potato shaped pieces of ice and rock. Some are so far away from Neptune that 
they need 29 years to circle Neptune once. Almost all of them are asteroids 
trapped by Neptune's gravity. 99.5% of all the mass around Neptune 
is concentrated in Triton. It's the 7th biggest moon, and 
more massive than all other known moons in the solar system that are 
smaller than itself combined. Its surface area is about as big as the 
mainland of Russia and Australia together. Also, Triton is one of only four objects 
in the solar system that we know is geologically active. Triton orbits Neptune in the 'wrong' direction, 
against the rotation of Neptune, which is unique in our solar system
for an object as big as Triton. We can conclude from this that 
Triton hasn't always been a moon of Neptune, but probably was a dwarf planet that 
was forced into submission by Neptune, when the solar system was younger 
and more chaotic. The most popular theory here is that
Triton was once part of a double system, when Neptune migrated 
to the outer edges of the solar system, its gravity interfered with the double system
and catapulted the other object into space, while Triton was forced into orbit. This would of disrupted the orbits 
of other Neptune moons rather violently and would most likely have 
either pushed them away from Neptune, or let them collide or crash into Neptune. This would explain why Neptune's moons 
are so dominated by Triton. But, this will end one day, Triton is being slowed down by Neptune, and eventually, it will either crash into it, or be ground by Neptune's gravity into 
a huge ring system, similar to Saturn's. So, don't by real estate on Triton. Fixed English Subtiles by

continent, China, the USA, Brazil, and South Africa together. Weight-wise, the moon is only about 1/81th of the mass of Earth, but how big is it in relation to Earth? Quite big actually, our moon is the biggest in
the solar system in relation to its planet, and it's the fifth largest moon in the solar system.
Quite a bit bigger than the dwarf planet Pluto. Now if the moon is really that huge,
how far away is it from us to seem this small in the night sky? 370 km, as far as the ISS maybe? No.
At that distance, gravitational forces would rip the moon apart. At 36000 km, it would be as far away as our most distant satellite. Let's adjust the distance to reality.
Pretty far away, right? A 747 would need 28 straight days to fly to the moon,
and even with our current technology, we'd need two full days. And in a car, a lot of time.

21eFwbb48sE,2014-04-10T12:00:04.000000,Who Invented the Internet? And Why?,"So, have you ever wondered who
actually invented the internet? Some people have become zillionaires
thanks to the internet. But all they did was invent clever
ways of using the internet. So the person who “invented the internet”
should be a gazillionaire equivalent to, say, God, shoudn't they? Who should get the credit, then? Was it a British geek in a Swiss
underground lab? Maybe. Clever Americans threatened with
nuclear annihilation by the Russians? Nice idea. French scientists who decided to call
their computer network the “Le Internet”? Interesting. Or was it thanks to a myriad of smart
scientists working on something they knew was useful, but didn’t realize
would be so big? Well, let’s try and get some
facts straight. There’s the internet, a whole bunch of
computer networks connected to each other, and then there’s the World Wide Web, a
way of making it easier to share information using all those
interconnected computers. The internet as we know it today was at
least 40 years in the making. One popular but wrong story is that the
internet was developed by the USA so they had a communication network that
would survive a nuclear war. According to one of the founders of the
first network, the ARPANET, in the 1960s, this first network experiment wasn’t about
communication at all; it was about optimizing processor usage,
or time-sharing, which basically meant that scientists
could share computer power, too. That was because until the 1960s there was
basically no network—you had big machines called mainframes which sat in the room
and processed computing tasks one at a time. With time-sharing, these behemoths could
process several tasks at a time, which meant their power could be used by
several scientists at once. And, obviously, once you start connecting
computers together, you start to wonder about
what you need to do to make communications
between them easier. Scientists around the world were trying to
solve this problem. So let’s look at some other key concepts
that were developed elsewhere. Starting with packet switching. In Britain, there was a commercial
network, developed by the National Physical Laboratory, but which
never really got off the ground because it didn’t get funding. But they did come up with the idea of
packet switching, a way of avoiding congestion in busy networks by
cutting up data at one end and putting it back together at the other. The French also played a role. They were working on a scientific network
called CYCLADES, but they didn’t have a big budget, so they
decided to work on direct connections between computers, as opposed to working
with gateway computers. Now, as an aside here, this, admittedly,
isn’t very scientific, but according to one theory, a spin-off of
their research was the word “internet”. But you don’t have to believe it
if you don’t want to. So, now it’s the early 1970s. There’s quite a lot of computer
infrastructure, but communication is awkward and patchy, because different
networks can’t talk to each other. TCP/IP solves this problem. The TCP/IP protocols form the basic
communication language of the internet, which labels the packets of data
and makes sure that even though some pieces of the same data
take a different route, they all arrive at their destination and
can be reassembled. Networks really began communicating
with each other in 1975, so you could argue that was
the beginning of the internet. Email was also very important. It was developed for ARPANET in 1972. Most internet traffic in 1976 was email,
because academics thought electronic post-it notes were dead-core. With networks that could talk to each
other, communication was becoming easier. But all this communication was just text-
based, and it was pretty ugly to look at. In the 1980s, a Brit called
Timothy Berners-Lee spent time with CERN, the European
Organization for Nuclear Research, where physicists are trying to work out
what the universe is made of. He wanted to manage the scientists’
information and make it possible for them to share and interconnect
their work easily, making progress more likely. He did so by inventing an interface
using HTTP, HTML, and URLs that made internet browsers possible. He called his browser the World Wide Web. So he didn’t invent the internet,
but he did invent the Web. The first ever website, which he created,
was at CERN in France in August 1991. So, once the initial infrastructure
was in place, the key technologies had been invented, internet message boards
exploded in the 1980s, the phone companies saw the commercial
potential of digital communication, web browsers spread like wildfire in the
early 1990s, and ordinary people discovered email, then the internet expanded

invent the internet? Ugh… no. And if you read what he said exactly,
you’ll know he never claimed to have done. But many people credit him with

need to communicate, and most of us like doing it. That’s why humans have become
the dominant species on Earth. You could argue that the internet is
a natural evolutionary step and a manifestation of that need. It wasn’t invented by anyone
in particular, but when the building blocks were put
together by all those cool scientists from all over the place, the internet
became a communication tool, a retail tool, a research tool,
a propaganda tool, a spying tool, a shopping tool, a dating tool,
an entertainment tool, and a way of skiving off work while making
it look like you’re working or studying, which is what you may be doing now. Ultimately, though, you’re communicating,

wNDGgL73ihY,2014-03-03T15:01:45.000000,The Beginning of Everything -- The Big Bang,"The beginning of everything. The Big Bang. The idea that the universe was suddenly
born and is not infinite. Up to the middle of the 20th century,
most scientists thought of the universe as infinite and ageless. Until Einstein’s theory of relativity gave
us a better understanding of gravity, and Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies
are moving apart from one another in a way that fits previous predictions. In 1964, by accident, cosmic background
radiation was discovered, a relic of the early universe, which, together with other observational
evidence, made the Big Bang the accepted theory in science. Since then, improved technology like the
Hubble telescope has given us a pretty good picture of the
Big Bang and the structure of the cosmos. Recent observations even seem to suggest
that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. But how did this Big Bang work? How can something come from nothing? Let’s explore what we know. We can ignore the beginning part
for now. First of all, the Big Bang was not
an explosion. It was all space stretching
everywhere all at once. The universe started
very, very, very small and quickly expanded to the
size of a football. The universe didn’t expand into anything,
space was just expanding into itself. The universe cannot expand into anything
because the universe has no borders; there is, by definition, no “outside”
the universe. The universe is all there is. In this hot, dense environment, energy
manifested itself in particles that existed only for the
tiniest glimpses of time. >From gluons, pairs of quarks were created,
which destroyed one another, perhaps after giving off more gluons. These found other short-lived quarks
to interact with, forming new quark pairs and
gluons again. Matter and energy were not just
theoretically equivalent, it was so hot they were practically
the same stuff. Somewhere around this time, matter
won over antimatter. Today, we’re left with almost all
matter and nearly no antimatter at all. Somehow, one billion and one matter
particles were formed for every one billion particles of
antimatter. Instead of one massive ultimate force
in the universe, there were now several refined versions
of it acting under different rules. By now the universe has stretched to a
billion kilometers in diameter, which leads to a decrease in temperature. The cycle of quarks being born and
converted back to energy suddenly stops. >From now on, we work with what we have. Quarks begin forming new particles,
hadrons, like protons and neutrons. There are many, many combinations of
quarks that can form all sorts of hadrons, but only very few are reasonably stable
for any length of time. Please take a moment to appreciate that
by now, only one second has passed since the beginning of everything. The universe, which has grown to one
hundred billion kilometers, is now cold enough to allow most of the
neutrons to decay into protons and form the first atom, hydrogen. Imagine the universe at this point as an
extremely hot soup, ten billion degrees Celsius, filled with
countless particles and energy. Over the next few minutes, things cooled
and settled down very fast. Atoms formed out of hadrons and electrons, making for a stable and electrically
neutral environment. Some call this period the Dark Age,
because there were no stars and the hydrogen gas didn’t allow visible
light to move around. But what’s the meaning of visible light,
anyway, when there’s nothing alive yet that could have eyes? When the hydrogen gas clumped together
after millions of years and gravity put it under great pressure, stars
and galaxies began to form. Their radiation dissolved the stable
hydrogen gas into a plasma that still permeates the universe today
and allows visible light to pass. Finally, there was light! Okay, but what about the part
we didn’t talk about? What happened right at the beginning? This part can be defined as the Big Bang. We don’t know at all what happened here. At this point, our tools break down. Natural laws stop making sense,
time itself becomes wibbly-wobbly. To understand what happened here,
we need a theory that unifies Einstein’s relativity and quantum
mechanics, something countless scientists are working on right now. But this leaves us with lots of
unanswered questions. Were there universes before our own? Is this the first and only universe? What started the Big Bang, or did it
just occur naturally, based on laws we don’t understand yet? We don’t know, and maybe we never will. But what we do know is that the universe
as we know it started here and gave birth to particles, galaxies,
stars, the Earth, and you. Since were ourselves are made of
dead stars, we are not separate from the universe; we are part of it. You could even say that we are the
universe’s way of experiencing itself. So, let’s keep on experiencing it, until
there are no more questions to ask. Subtitles by the Amara.org community"
4_aOIA-vyBo,2014-02-03T16:35:03.000000,Three Ways to Destroy the Universe,"One day the universe will die. But why? And how? And will the universe
be dead forever? And how do we know that? First of all, the universe is expanding. And not only that, the rate of
its expansion is accelerating. The reason: dark energy. Dark energy is a strange phenomenon that
scientists believe permeates the universe. Until 1998 we thought that the universe
must work a bit like a ball that you throw into the sky. The ball moves up, but at some point
it has to come down again. But the expansion of the universe
is actually speeding up. That’s like throwing a ball up
and watching it fly away faster and faster and faster. Where is this acceleration coming from? Well, we don’t know, but
we call it “dark energy”. Einstein thought of it first and
then decided it was stupid. Now, astrophysicists have
decided it is plausible. Trouble is, this is all very theoretical,
and we don’t actually know what the properties of dark energy are. But there are various theories and they
lead us to three scenarios for the end of the universe. One: the Big Rip. Since its birth, the universe
has been expanding. For unknown reasons new spaces
created everywhere equally. The space between galaxies expands,
so they move apart. The space inside galaxies also expands,
but here, gravity is strong enough to keep them together. In the Big Rip scenario, the expansion
accelerates up to a point where space expands so fast that gravity
can’t compensate for this effect anymore. The result is a Big Rip. At first, only large structures like
galaxies are torn apart, since space between the single objects
expands very fast. Next, big bodies like black holes,
stars, and planets die. Their gravity isn’t strong enough to keep
them together, so they dissolve into their components. In the end, space would expand
faster than the speed of light. Atoms would now be affected,
and they would just disband. Once space is expanding faster than light,
no particle in the universe can interact with any other particle anymore. The universe would dissolve into countless
lonely particles that won’t be able to touch anything else in a strange,
timeless universe. Hmm, and you thought you felt lonely! Two: Heat death or a Big Freeze. In a nutshell, the difference between
the Big Rip and heat death is that in a heat death scenario matter stays
intact and is converted over an incredibly long but finite period
of time into radiation, while the universe expands forever. But how does this work?
Let’s talk about entropy. Every system tends towards the
state of highest entropy, like when we have a latte macchiato. Initially, it has different regions, but
over time, they will cool down and disintegrate,
until it’s uniform. And this also applies to the universe. So, while the universe gets
bigger and bigger, matters slowly decays and spreads out. At some point, after lots of generations
of stars, all the gas clouds necessary to form stars will be exhausted,
so the universe will turn dark. The remaining suns will die;
 black holes will slowly degenerate
and evaporate over trillions of years due to what’s known as Hawking radiation. When this process is complete, only a
dilute gas of photons and light particles remains, until even this decays. All activity in the universe ceases
at this point; entropy is at its maximum and
the universe is dead forever. Unless… theoretically, it might
be possible that after an incredibly
long amount of time, there might be a spontaneous entropy
decrease as a result of something called “quantum tunneling”, leading to
a new Big Bang. Three: Big Crunch and Big Bounce. This is the most uplifting scenario. If there is less dark energy than we think
or it decreases over time, gravity will be the dominating force in the
universe one day. In a few trillion years, the rate of
expansion of the universe will slow down and stop. After that, it reverses. Galaxies will race at each other,
merging as the universe becomes smaller and smaller. Since a smaller universe also means
a hotter universe, temperatures rise everywhere all at once. One hundred thousand years before the Big
Crunch, background radiation would be hotter than the surfaces of the
most stars, which means that they would be cooked from the outside. Minutes before the Big Crunch happens,
atom cores are ripped apart, before supermassive black holes
devour everything. Finally, all black holes would emerge into
a supermassive mega-black hole that contains the entire
mass of the universe, and in the last moment before
the Big Crunch it would devour the universe,
including itself. The Big Bounce theory states that this
has happened a lot of times and that the universe goes through
an infinite cycle of expansion and contraction. Well, wouldn’t that be nice? So what will actually happen to
the universe in the end? At the moment, heat death seems the most
likely, but we at Kurzgesagt hope that this “dead forever” stuff is wrong and the
universe will start over and over again. We don't know for sure either way, so
let’s just assume the most uplifting theory is true. By the way, we have a Twitter account. Subtitles by the Amara.org community"

F3QpgXBtDeo,2013-11-28T17:03:32.000000,How The Stock Exchange Works (For Dummies),"What is the Stock Exchange 
and how does it work? The Stock Exchange is nothing more 
than a giant globally network tend to organize the market place where every day 
huge sums of money are moved back and forth. In total over sixty trillion (60,000,000,000,000) 
Euros a year are traded. More than the value of all goods and services 
of the entire world economy. However it's not apples or second hand 
toothbrushes that are traded on this marketplace. But predominantly securities. Securities are rights to assets, 
mostly in the form of shares. A share stands for 
a share in a company. But why are shares traded at all? Well, first and foremost the value of a share 
relates to the company behind it. If you think the value of 
a company in terms of a pizza. The bigger the overal size of the pizza, 
the bigger every piece is. If for example Facebook is able to greatly 
increase its profits with a new buisness model. The size of the companies pizza will also increase, 
and as a result so will the value of its shares. This is of course great for the share holders. A share which perhaps used to be worth 38 euros 
could now be worth a whole 50 euros. When it's sold this represents 
a profit of twelve euro per share! But what does Facebook gain from this? The company can raise funds by selling 
the shares and invest or expand it's buisness. Facebook, for example, has earned sixteen billion 
dollars from it's listing on the Stock Exchange. The trading of shares though, 
is frequently a game of chance. No one can say which company 
will preform well and which will not. If a company has a good reputation, 
investors will back it. A company with a poor reputation or poor 
performance will have difficulty selling its shares. Unlike a normal market in which goods 
can be touched and taken home on the Stock Exchange only 
virtual goods are available. They apear in the form of share prices 
and tables on monitors. Such shareprices can rise 
or fall within seconds. Shareholders therefore have to act quickly 
in order not to miss an opportunity. Even a simple rumor can result in the demand for 
a share falling fast regardless of the real value of the company. Of course the opposite is also possible. If a particularly large number
of people buy weak shares. Because if they see for example 
great potential behind an idea. Their value will rise as a result. In particular young companies 
can benefit from this. Even though their sales might be falling, 
they can generate cash by placing their shares. In the best case scenario this will result in 
their idea being turned into reality. In the worst case scenario, this will result in a 
speculative bubble with nothing more than hot air. And as the case with bubbles, 
at some point, they will burst. The value of Germany's biggest thirty companies 
is summarized in what is known as the DAX share index. The DAX shows how well or poorly 
these major companies and there by the economy as a whole 
are performing at the present time. Stock Exchange is in other countries 
also have there own indices. And all of these markets together 
create a globally networked marketplace. Subtitles by the Amara.org community"
UuGrBhK2c7U,2013-10-11T19:11:39.000000,The Gulf Stream Explained,"The ocean conveyor belt and
the Gulf Stream. Ocean currents have a direct
influence on our lives. They determine our weather, our
climate, and much more. The ocean currents and wind systems transport heat from the equator
to the poles and operate like a large engine
for the global climate. In the oceans, there are numerous
currents. The so-called ocean conveyor belt
is very important for our climate. This term describes a combination
of currents that result in four of the five global
oceans exchanging water with each other. They form a worldwide circulation system. The conveyor belt is also called the
thermohaline circulation, with “thermo” referring to
the temperature, and “haline” to the salt content
of the water. Both determine the density of the water. While the masses of water may be
moved in part by wind, primarily the different densities
of the global oceans are responsible for their movement. Warm water has a lower density and rises
while cold water sinks. The water’s density also increases with
a higher salt content. At the equator the heat from the
sun is especially strong, resulting in a lot of evaporation and
thus a rise in the water’s salt content. That is where the Gulf Stream begins. The Gulf Stream is very important
for the European climate. Its length of 10,000 km makes it one of
the largest and fastest currents on Earth, and it’s very warm. At roughly 2 m/s it brings up to
100,000,000 m³ of water per second towards Europe. A constantly blowing wind, the
southeast trade wind, drives warm surface water to
the northwest, into the Gulf of Mexico, where it heats up
to 30 °C. The turning of the Earth and the
west winds then direct the Gulf Stream towards Europe
and split it up. One part flows south, another east
to the Canary Current, and a third part flows north where
it releases a lot of heat into the atmosphere as the
North Atlantic Current. The water becomes colder there. Its salt content and density rise on
the account of evaporation and it drops down between
Greenland, Norway, and Iceland. There we also find the largest
waterfall on Earth. The so-called Chimneys, roughly 15-km-wide
pillars with water falling up to 4,000 m. 17,000,000 m³ of water per second, or
roughly 15 times more water than is carried by all the rivers in the world. This creates a strong maelstrom, which
constantly pulls in new water and is the reason that the Gulf Stream
moves towards Europe. Countless species use the Gulf Stream as a
means of transport on their trips from the Caribbean to northern areas. But it doesn’t just bring us animals; an enormous quantity of warm air also
comes with it. In order to produce the same heat that it
brings to the shores of Europe, we would need 1,000,000 nuclear
power plants. That’s why we also call the Gulf Stream
a heat pump. Without it, the temperature would
be significantly colder here, at least five to ten degrees. Instead of lush fields, we would have
long winters and sparse ice-covered landscapes in Europe. In the last few years, scientists and
pundits in the media have repeatedly expressed the fear that the Gulf Stream
could come to a standstill due to climate change. Because if the polar caps actually melt,
the salt content in the water off Greenland would fall, as would
its density. The North Atlantic Current would no longer
be heavy enough, and so it woundn’t sink as usual. In the worst case, that would bring the
Gulf Stream, our heat pump, to a stop. Some climate experts also assume that
climate change could compensate for this effect. We know that it can be normal for the
climate to change by looking at the development of the Earth
over the last few million years. There are ice ages and warm periods. In the last ice age, a gigantic flood of
melting water crippled the heat-bringing North Atlantic Current,
covering the northern hemisphere in ice. Scientists have different views on the
impact that climate change will have on the global ocean conveyor belt, but
one thing is clear: when the climate changes, then the complex
system of ocean currents and winds, which has remained fairly stable since the
last ice age, will change in ways that we don’t
yet understand. Subtitles by the Amara.org community"
Uti2niW2BRA,2013-09-03T09:12:24.000000,Fracking explained: opportunity or danger,"What is hydraulic fracturing – or fracking ? Since the industrial revolution our energy consumption has risen unceasingly. The majority of this energy consumption is supplied by fossil fuels like coal or natural gas. Recently there has been a lot of talk about a controversial method of extracting natural gas: Hydraulic fracturing or fracking. Put simply, fracking describes the recovery of natural gas from deep layers inside the earth. In this method, porous rock is fractured by the use of water, sand and chemicals in order to release the enclosed natural gas. The technique of fracking has been known since the 1940s. Nonetheless, only in the last ten years has there been quite a “fracking boom”, especially in the USA. This is because most conventional natural gas sources in America and on the European continent have been exhausted. Thus prices for natural gas and other fuels are rising steadily. Significantly more complicated and expensive methods, like fracking, have now become attractive and profitable. In the meantime, fracking has already been used more than a million times in the USA alone. Over 60% of all new oil and gas wells are drilled by using fracking. Now let’s take a look at how fracking actually works: First, a shaft is drilled several hundred meters into the earth. From there, a horizontal hole is drilled into the gas-bearing layer of rock. Next, the fracking fluid is pumped into the ground using high-performance pumps. On average, the fluid consists of 8 million liters of water which amounts to about the daily consumption of 65,000 people. plus several thousand tons of sand and about 200,000 liters of chemicals. The mixture penetrates into the rock layer and produces innumerable tiny cracks. The sand prevents the cracks from closing again. The chemicals perform various tasks among other things, they condense the water, kill off bacteria or dissolve minerals. Next, the majority of the fracking fluid is pumped out again. And now the natural gas can be recovered. As soon as the gas source is exhausted, the drill hole is sealed. As a rule, the fracking fluid is pumped back into deep underground layers and sealed in there. However, fracking is also associated with several considerable risks. The primary risk consists in the contamination of drinking water sources. Fracking not only consumes large quantities of fresh water, but in addition the water is subsequently contaminated and is highly toxic. The contamination is so severe that the water cannot even be cleaned in a treatment plant. Even though the danger is known and theoretically could be managed, in the USA already sources have been contaminated due to negligence. No one yet knows how the enclosed water will behave in the future, since there have not yet been any long-term studies on the subject. The chemicals used in fracking vary from the hazardous to the extremely toxic and carcinogenic, such as benzol or formic acid. The companies using fracking say nothing about the precise composition of the chemical mixture. But it is known that there are about 700 different chemical agents which can be used in the process. Another risk is the release of greenhouse gases. The natural gas recovered by fracking consists largely of methane, a greenhouse gas which is 25 times
more potent than carbon dioxide. Natural gas is less harmful than coal when burned. But nonetheless, the negative effects of fracking on the climate balance are overall greater. Firstly, the fracking process requires
a very large consumption of energy. Secondly, the drill holes are quickly exhausted and it is necessary to drill fracking holes much more frequently than for classical natural gas wells. In addition, about 3% of the recovered gas is lost in the extraction and escapes into the atmosphere. So how is fracking and its expected benefits to be assessed when the advantages are balanced against the disadvantages? When properly employed, this technique offers one way in the short to medium term for meeting our demand for lower-cost energy. But the long-term consequences of fracking are unforeseeable and the risk to our drinking water thus should not be underestimated. Subtitles by the Amara.org community"

hOfRN0KihOU,2013-07-11T14:09:52.000000,How Evolution works,"Mechanisms of evolution What is evolution? Evolution is the development of life on Earth. This is a process that began billions of years ago and is still continuing to this day. Evolution tells us how it was possible for the enormous diversity of life to develop. It shows us how primitive Protozoa could become the millions of different species that we see today. Evolution, then, is the answer to the question that we have all asked on seeing a Daschund and a Great Dane together: how is it possible for ancestors to have descendants that look so very different to them? In answering this question, we want to focus on animals, excluding other forms of life such as fungi and plants. The first question to ask is therefore: how can one animal develop into a whole new species of animal? Ah, but just a quick question: what exactly is a species? A species is a community of animals that is capable of producing offspring with one another, with those offspring also being capable of reproducing in turn. To understand this answer better, we need to take a closer look at the following points: the uniqueness of living creatures, guaranteed through the excess production of offspring and heredity, and as a second key point, selection. Let's begin with uniqueness. Every creature that exists is unique, and this is essential for evolution. The members of a species may strongly resemble each other in appearance; however, they all have slightly different traits and characteristics. They may be a bit bigger, fatter, stronger, or bolder than their fellow animals. So, what is the reason for these differences? Let's take a closer look at a creature. Every creature is made up of cells. These cells have a nucleus. The nucleus contains the chromosomes, and the chromosomes hold the DNA. DNA consists of different genes, and it's these genes that are life's information carriers. They contain instructions and orders for the cells, and determine the characteristics and traits that living creatures have, and it's precisely this DNA that is unique to every creature. It's slightly different from individual to individual, which is why each has slightly different characteristics. But how is the enormous range of DNA created? One key factor is the excess production of offspring. In nature, we can observe that creatures generally produce far more offspring than is necessary for the survival of their species, with many offspring dying an early death as a result. Often there are even more offspring than the environment in which they live is able to support. This is one factor in increasing diversity within a species. The more offspring that are produced, the more little differences occur, and this is what nature wants: as many little differences as possible. The second major cause of the uniqueness of individuals occurs in heredity itself. By the way, heredity means the passing on of DNA to offspring. Two very interesting factors come into play in this process: recombination and mutation. Recombination is the random mixing of the DNA of two creatures. When two creatures fall in love and mate, they recombine their genes twice. The first time, they do this separately when they generate the gametes - that is, sperm and egg cells. The gametes take half of the genes and shuffle them. The second recombination occurs when a male inseminates a female. The parents each provide 50% of their DNA, in other words, 50% of their unique traits and characteristics. These are then recombined, or mixed, and the result is new offspring. These offspring have a random mix of the DNA, and therefore the traits and characteristics of their parents. This increases the diversity and differences within a species even further, but mutations are also important for evolution. Mutations are random changes in DNA. These can also be described as copying errors within the DNA, triggered by toxins or other chemical substances, or by radiation. A mutation exists when part of the DNA is altered. These changes are often negative, and may result in illnesses such as cancer. However, they may also have neutral or positive effects, such as the blue eye colour in humans, which is one such random mutation. In all cases, a mutation has to affect a gamete, that is a sperm or egg cell, because only the DNA in the gametes is passed on to the offspring. This is also the reason why we protect our sexual organs during x-rays, whilst other parts of the body are not at risk. In summary then, in the heredity process, creatures pass on their characteristics to their offspring in the form of DNA. Recombination and mutation change the DNA so that each child looks different to its siblings, and receives a random mix of the characteristics of its parents. There's a key word here: random. All of these processes are based on chance. Random recombination and mutations result in individuals with random mixes of traits and characteristics, which in turn mix these randomly, and pass them on. But how can so much be down to chance, when all living creatures are so perfectly adapted to their environment, for example, the stick insect, the hummingbird, and the frogfish? The answer is provided by the second key point: selection. Each individual is subjected to a process of natural selection. As we have learned, each individual is somewhat different to its fellows, and there is extensive variation within a species. Environmental influences have an effect on living creatures. These so-called selection factors include: predators, parasites, animals of the same species, toxins, changes in habitat, or the climate. Selection is a process that each individual is subjected to. Every creature has a unique mix of traits and characteristics. This mix helps them to survive in their environment, or not, as the case may be. Anyone with an unsuitable mix will be selected from the environment. Those with the right mix survive, and can pass on their enhanced traits and characteristics. This is why diversity is so important. This is why creatures make so much effort to produce offspring that are as different as possible. They increase the likelihood that at least one of their offspring passes nature's selection process. They maximize their chances of survival. A good example of this can be seen in a group of finches living on a remote island. They are some of the most famous animals in the world of science, and are known as Darwin finches, after their discoverer, Charles Darwin, and this is the story of those finches. A few hundred years ago, a small group of finches was blown onto the Galapagos Islands in the middle of the Pacific, probably by a big storm. The finches found themselves in an environment that was completely new to them, a real finch paradise: an abundance of food and no predators. They reproduced rapidly and numerously. The islands were soon heaving with finches. This meant that food supplies became increasingly scarce. The finch paradise was threatened with famine, and finch friends became competitors. This is when selection intervened. Their individuality and small differences, in this case their slightly different beaks, meant that some of the birds were able to avoid competing with their fellow finches. The beaks of some of the finches were more suitable for digging for worms. Other finches were able to use their beaks better for cracking seeds. The finches consequently sort out ecological niches. In these niches, they were safe from excessive competition. They soon began to mate primarily with other finches that used the same niche. Over the course of many generations, these characteristics were enhanced, enabling the finches to exploit their niches successfully. The differences between the worm-diggers and the seed-crackers became so large that they were no longer able to mate with one another. Different species emerged as a result. Today, there are 14 different species of finch living on the Galapagos Islands, all of which are descended from the same group of stranded finches. This is how new species are created by evolution: through the interaction of unique individuals, the excess production of offspring, recombination and mutation in heredity, and finally, through selection. Why is this so important? It tells us where the variety of life comes from, and why living creatures are so perfectly adapted to their habitats. But it also effects us personally. Every person is the result of 3.5 billion years of evolution, and that includes you. Your ancestors fought and adapted in order to survive. This survival was an extremely uncertain thing. If we consider the fact that 99% of all the species that have ever lived are extinct, then you can consider yourself part of a success story. The dinosaurs have disappeared, but you are alive, watching this video, because you're incredibly special, just like all the other creatures that exist today: irreproducible and unique in the universe."
